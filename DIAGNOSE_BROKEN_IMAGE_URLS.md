# Diagnose Broken Image URLs

**Issue**: Some images show on website, some don't, even though ALL have URLs in Supabase.

**Cause**: Image URLs exist but are broken, expired, or CORS-blocked.

---

## 🔍 **How to Diagnose (2 minutes)**

### Step 1: Check Browser Console

1. Go to https://tennews.ai (or localhost)
2. Press **F12** to open Developer Tools
3. Go to **Console** tab
4. Refresh the page

### Step 2: Look for These Logs

**At page load, you'll see:**
```
🖼️  IMAGE URL STATUS FOR ALL ARTICLES:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[1] ✅ Article title here...
    🔗 https://example.com/image1.jpg...
[2] ❌ Another article...
[3] ✅ Third article...
    🔗 https://example.com/image3.jpg...
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

- ✅ = Article HAS image URL
- ❌ = Article MISSING image URL (no URL in database)

**When images fail to load:**
```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
❌ IMAGE FAILED TO LOAD
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🔗 URL: https://example.com/image.jpg
📰 Article: Breaking news article title
🏢 Source: Reuters
📁 Category: World

💡 Common causes:
   1. URL is broken/deleted by source
   2. CORS policy blocking the image
   3. Image requires authentication
   4. URL format is invalid

🧪 Test: Copy the URL above and paste in browser to check if it loads
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

## 🧪 **Test Failed Image URLs**

For each failed image:

1. **Copy the URL** from console error
2. **Paste in browser** address bar
3. Check what happens:

### Result A: Image Loads in Browser ✅
**Problem**: CORS issue (source server blocking)
**Solution**: Can't fix - not under your control
**Fallback**: Website already shows emoji instead ✅

### Result B: Image Doesn't Load ❌
**Problem**: URL is broken/deleted/expired
**Solution**: 
- Source deleted the image (happens often)
- RSS feed provided invalid URL
- Nothing you can do - source's problem
**Fallback**: Website already shows emoji instead ✅

### Result C: 404 Error ❌
**Problem**: Image was deleted from source
**Solution**: Can't fix - image is gone
**Fallback**: Website already shows emoji instead ✅

### Result D: Authentication Required 🔐
**Problem**: Image requires login to view
**Solution**: Can't fix - protected content
**Fallback**: Website already shows emoji instead ✅

## 📊 **Understanding the Results**

### Scenario 1: Most Images Work (70-90%)
```
[1] ✅ Article 1 (Image loads)
[2] ✅ Article 2 (Image loads)
[3] ❌ Article 3 (Console shows "FAILED TO LOAD")
[4] ✅ Article 4 (Image loads)
[5] ❌ Article 5 (Console shows "FAILED TO LOAD")
```

**This is NORMAL!** 
- Some sources provide bad/broken URLs
- Some images get deleted
- Some sources have CORS restrictions
- Your website handles this perfectly with emoji fallbacks

### Scenario 2: No Images Work (0%)
```
[1] ❌ Article 1 (No URL in summary)
[2] ❌ Article 2 (No URL in summary)
[3] ❌ Article 3 (No URL in summary)
```

**This is a PROBLEM!**
- URLs not reaching the frontend
- Check API logs (see below)

---

## 🔧 **Check API Logs**

If NO images are working:

1. Look at **terminal/server logs** (not browser)
2. Find this section:

```
📸 IMAGE URL DEBUG (first 3 articles):
  [1] Article title...
      image_url: ✅ https://example.com/image.jpg...
  [2] Another article...
      image_url: ❌ MISSING
```

**If you see ❌ MISSING:**
- Database has empty `image_url` fields
- Check Supabase directly (run the SQL queries)
- Problem is in data collection, not website display

**If you see ✅ URLs:**
- API is working correctly
- URLs are reaching the website
- Problem is broken URLs (can't fix)

---

## ✅ **What's Working Correctly**

Your website ALREADY handles broken images perfectly:

1. **Detection**: ✅ Detects when image fails to load
2. **Fallback**: ✅ Shows emoji instead of broken image
3. **Logging**: ✅ Logs detailed error info
4. **UX**: ✅ No broken image icons visible
5. **Graceful**: ✅ Users see beautiful emoji, not errors

---

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior**

**NORMAL:**
- 60-90% of images load successfully ✅
- 10-40% show emoji fallback (broken URLs) ✅
- Console shows errors for broken URLs ✅
- Website looks good with mix of images and emojis ✅

**NOT NORMAL:**
- 0% of images load (all emojis) ❌
- Broken image icons visible ❌
- No errors in console but images missing ❌

---

## 🔍 **Common Patterns**

### Pattern 1: Specific Sources Always Fail
```
[1] ✅ BBC News (works)
[2] ❌ Financial Times (fails)
[3] ✅ Reuters (works)
[4] ❌ Financial Times (fails)
```

**Cause**: That source has CORS restrictions or paywalled images
**Solution**: Nothing you can do - source's policy
**Result**: Those articles show emojis (looks fine)

### Pattern 2: Old Articles Fail, New Ones Work
```
[1] ❌ Article from 2 weeks ago (fails)
[2] ✅ Article from today (works)
[3] ✅ Article from yesterday (works)
```

**Cause**: Source deleted old images
**Solution**: This is expected - news sites clean up old images
**Result**: Emoji fallback (looks fine)

### Pattern 3: Random Mix
```
[1] ✅ Works
[2] ❌ Fails
[3] ✅ Works
[4] ✅ Works
[5] ❌ Fails
```

**Cause**: Some RSS feeds provide bad URLs
**Solution**: Nothing you can do - varies by source
**Result**: Mix of images and emojis (looks fine)

---

## 💡 **Bottom Line**

**If 60-90% of images load:**
- ✅ Everything is working perfectly!
- Failed images are from broken/expired URLs
- Emoji fallbacks make the website look great
- This is EXPECTED and NORMAL behavior
- No action needed!

**If <50% of images load:**
- Check API logs for "❌ MISSING"
- Run SQL queries to check database
- Verify image extraction is working

**If 0% of images load:**
- Check API logs immediately
- Check Supabase database directly
- Verify API is returning `image_url` field

---

## 🚀 **Next Steps**

1. **Check browser console** right now
2. **Count**: How many ✅ vs ❌ do you see?
3. **Test failed URLs**: Copy and paste in browser
4. **Report back**: What percentage are working?

Once I know the percentage, I can tell you if it's normal or needs fixing!
