      "url": "https://fortune.com/2025/10/13/tariffs-trump-holiday-hiring-shopping-inflation-shrinks-retailers/",
      "source": "Fortune",
      "description": "Deloitte Services forecasts holiday retail sales to be up between 2.9% to 3.4% from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31, a slowdown from 2024.",
      "content": "Uncertainty over the economy and tariffs is forcing retailers to pull back or delay plans to hire seasonal workers who pack orders at distribution centers, serve shoppers at stores and build holiday displays during the most important selling season of the year.\nAmerican Christmas LLC, which creates elaborate holiday installations for commercial properties such as New York\u2019s Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall, plans to hire 220 temporary workers and is ramping up recruitment nearly two months later than usual, CEO Dan Casterella said. Last year, the company took on 300 people during its busy period.\nThe main reason? The company wants to offset its tariff bill, which Casterella expects to be as big as $1.5 million this year, more than double last year\u2019s $600,000.\n\u201cThe issue is if you overstaff and then you underperform, it\u2019s too late,\u201d Casterella said. \u201dI think everyone\u2019s more mindful now than ever. \u201d\nHoliday hiring could fall to the lowest level since 2009\nJob placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas forecasts hiring for the last three months of the year will likely fall under 500,000 positions. That\u2019s fewer than last year\u2019s 543,000 level and also marks the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years when retailers hired 495,800 temporary workers, the firm said. The average seasonal gain since 2005 has been 653,363 workers, the firm said.\nAmong other companies cutting holiday payrolls: Radial, which powers deliveries for roughly 120 brands like Lands\u2019 End and Cole Haan and operates 20 fulfillment sites. It plans to hire 6,500 workers, fewer than last year\u2019s 7,000, and is waiting to the last minute to ramp up hiring for some of its clients, chief human resources officer Sabrina Wnorowski, said.\nBath & Body Works, based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, said it plans to hire 32,000 workers, lower than the 32,700 a year ago.\nAmong the bright spots: Online behemoth Amazon Inc. said Monday it intends to hire 250,000 full-, part-time and seasonal workers for the crucial shopping period, the same level as a year ago.\n\u201cWe saw real strong signals that there\u2019s been a cooling in the labor market, even beyond what our expectations were in the first nine months of the year,\u201d Challenger\u2019s senior vice president Andy Challenger said. \u201cWe are having lots of regular conversations with companies about pending layoffs and changes they\u2019re making to their workforce.\u201d\nIn addition to overall economic uncertainty, Challenger noted companies are using\u00a0artificial intelligence\u00a0bots to replace some workers, particularly those working in call centers. And he\u2019s also seeing companies hiring workers closer to when they need them.\nMeanwhile, the list of companies staying mum about their specific holiday hiring goals keeps growing. Target Corp., UPS and Macy\u2019s are declining to offer figures, a departure from the past. UPS had hired 125,000 seasonal hires last year, while Target announced last year it planned to hire 100,000 workers. Macy\u2019s last year said it would hire 31,500 seasonal workers.\nHoliday hiring: the first clues to what\u2019s in store for spending\nRetailers\u2019 hiring plans mark the first clues to what\u2019s in store for the U.S. holiday shopping season and come as the U.S. job market has\u00a0lost momentum this year, partly because\u00a0Trump\u2019s trade wars\u00a0have created uncertainty that\u2019s paralyzing managers trying to make hiring decisions.\nThe\u00a0Labor Department\u00a0reported in early September that U.S. employers \u2014 companies, government agencies and nonprofits \u2014 added just 22,000 jobs in August, down from 79,000 in July and well below the 80,000 that economists had expected.\nThe government shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and has delayed the release of economic reports, could worsen the job picture.\nIn an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues, the White House budget office said Friday that\u00a0mass firings of federal workers have started.\nThe firings are happening as hundreds of thousands are already furloughed and still others are being required to report to duty without pay.\nAnalysts will be closely monitoring the shutdown\u2019s impact on spending. For now, many retailers say that consumers, while resilient, are choosy about what they buying. Analysts will also be closely watching how shoppers will react as retailers push through price increases as a result of high tariff costs in the next few months, experts said.\nGiven an economic slowdown, holiday spending growth is expected to be smaller than a year ago, according to several forecasts.\nMastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods including cash, predicts that holiday sales will be up 3.6% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase during the year-ago period.\nDeloitte Services LP forecasts holiday retail sales to be up between 2.9% to 3.4% from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31. That\u2019s compared to the same year-ago period when retail sales increased 4.2% from the year before.\nAdobe expects U.S. online sales to hit $253.4 billion this holiday season from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, representing a 5.3% growth. That\u2019s smaller than last year\u2019s 8.7% growth.\nA more flexible approach\nGiven the uncertainty, companies increasingly want to hire workers closer to when they need them, experts said.\n\u201cIn today\u2019s environment, brands are really looking for us to be agile,\u201d Radial\u2019s Wnorowski said. \u201cRadial is meeting that need of the customer and the consumer with a more flexible and disciplined approach to hiring.\u201d\nSo for some of its clients, Radial will now be hiring two weeks before Thanksgiving weekend, the traditional start for the holiday shopping season, instead of four weeks before the kickoff, she said. Radial is also speeding up training of holiday hires due to new technology that\u2019s simplifying their tasks. It used to take a couple of days to train a worker, but now it only takes a couple of hours, she said.\nMeanwhile, Target said it\u2019s again embracing a three-prong approach. It starts first by offering current workers additional hours and then taps into a separate pool of workers\u2014 43,000\u2014 who pick up shifts that work for their schedules. The Minneapolis-based company also hires seasonal workers across its nearly 2,000 stores and more than 60 distribution facilities to meet demand, it said.\nFor the past few years, Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer and the largest private employer, has been offering the extra hours available during the holidays to its workers, a Walmart spokesperson said, noting it\u2019s worked well and the feedback from customers and workers has been \u201coverwhelmingly positive.\u201d\nThe Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said there may be some seasonal hiring on a store-by-store basis, but the majority of stores will dole out those hours to current workers.\nLate start plus no economic data could create challenges\nWaiting until the last minute to hire workers could mean a mad scramble to find talent, but companies say that due to the slowing economy, they don\u2019t anticipate having a hard time finding the needed pool.\nMeanwhile, the temporary halting of the release of economic reports leaves retailers in the dark about forecasting sales and the workers they need to meet the demand.\n\u201cCertainly, for our customers not having access to data will put more of a challenge on their ability to forecast,\u201d Wnorowski of Radial said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll stay very close to them as we go into peak and we\u2019ll adjust as soon we see things changing.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "description": "Ukraine's weapons makers are ready to make three times more weaponry, but they are limited by Ukraine's budget. NATO ally Denmark has a way to help.",
      "content": "Ukrainian companies make missiles, drones, ammunition, and other weaponry, and Denmark has started a new initiative to help them boost production.AP Photo/Efrem LukatskyUkraine's defense firms say they can make far more weaponry, but Ukraine doesn't have the budget.A new step by a NATO ally could help ease these concerns, among others.Denmark is offering Ukrainian firms the chance to make weapons on Danish soil with European funding.A NATO ally is offering a workaround to help with some of the biggest problems facing Ukraine's defense.Ukraine's defense output has soared since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, with companies pumping out drones, missiles, air defenses, and ammunition.Ukraine is constantly in need of more weaponry, but companies can only make as much as Ukraine's limited defense budget allows. The industry says that with more funding, it could scale up to more than three times its current output.Denmark's latest initiative is a small but important step toward addressing that problem, allowing Ukrainian manufacturers to produce equipment on Danish soil. It's designed to give Denmark access to Ukrainian tech and to also give those companies the support needed to produce more weapons for Ukraine's defense.By letting Ukrainian firms build weapons on Danish soil, the initiative turns Ukraine's wartime production crunch into a chance to expand its defense footprint abroad \u2014 channeling Danish funding and European stability into more reliable output for the war effort.Denmark's approachDenmark is allocating over $50 million to help firms start operations in the country under its \"Build for Ukraine\" initiative.The country's defense ministry described it as a joint Ukrainian-Danish weapons production project, noting it also benefits Denmark. Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said it will give his country's forces \"easier access to some of the newest technologies and experiences from Ukraine.\"Ukrainian companies, large and small, are making weaponry for the country's fight.Vitalii Nosach/Global Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesThis could be the kind of assistance Ukrainian industry leaders have long called for, arguing that allowing Ukrainian producers to sell weapons to partner nations\u2014 not just to their own government \u2014 lets them scale up and ultimately make more for Ukraine's fight.Ukraine's defense minister, Denys Shmyhal, said in August that the Build for Ukraine plan would also provide more weapons to his own troops, saying it would \"ensure more effective equipping of our warriors with everything they require.\" The joint projects are eligible for EU funding, the defense ministry said.Right now, Ukrainian rules surrounding exports are so stringent that companies and industry bodies working on its defense say that exports are effectively frozen. Denmark's new move could be something of an export opportunity, just via relocation. It opens the possibility for technology, know-how, and intellectual property transfers or collaborative development.That production being on NATO soil provides protection from Russian attacks and aligns with Ukraine's goal of integrating itself more with European militaries and industries. It also reduces security costs, which run high in a country at war.Serhiy Goncharov, CEO of the National Association of Ukrainian Defense Industries (NAUDI), which represents around 100 companies, told Business Insider that his organization wanted Ukrainian companies to be able to work on co-production ventures abroad, and he hopes other European countries will follow in the footsteps of the Danes.Ukraine's government, he said, simply cannot afford to buy \"all of the military production that can be produced in Ukraine,\" and this agreement allows the countries to \"support each other,\" combining Danish resources with Ukrainian expertise to get more equipment for both militaries.So far, only one Ukrainian company is planning to set up new operations in Denmark. Fire Point makes drones, missiles, and other weaponry. In Denmark, it's planning to make rocket fuel. More partnerships are expected, though.Ukrainian-made drones have been a core part of the country's defense, and an area Ukraine wants to make more of.Scott Peterson/Getty ImagesDenmark is eager to learn from Ukrainian companies on tech and swift production models as it and other European countries brace for the possibility of expanded Russian aggression.Poulsen, the defense minister, told BI in February that his country's defense industry has \"a lot to learn from Ukraine.\" He wants collaboration so that Denmark can \"get some of the lessons learned from the defense companies in Ukraine back to Danish defense companies.\"Ukraine's production problemsIt is vital that Ukraine scale up its defense sector and produce more of its own weapons. Throughout the war, Kyiv has faced recurring shortages from Western partners \u2014 either because partners could not afford to send more, didn't have the stockpiles, faced production backlogs, or, in some cases, wavered politically.Relying on its own weaponry allows Ukraine to avoid this problem, as well as the restrictions that partners have at times imposed on the weaponry, making them less useful for Ukraine.However, issues like budget constraints have held it back.Ukraine aims to produce much more of its own weaponry. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this month that more than 40% of the weapons used on the front line are Ukrainian-made. He wants to see that number increase to 50% by the end of the year.Other efforts are underway to help Ukraine ramp up production, like new movement on the possibility of exports abroad.Being able to produce on foreign soil offers valuable protection that reduces the strain on defense companies that are forced to break apart and disperse operations at home to avoid becoming top targets for a Russian attack.\"We try to be smart about it and not create a big enough target for it to attract too much attention,\" the CEO of Ukrainian autonomous systems developer Ark Robotics told Business Insider. The problem is that these preventive measures slow things down and make it hard to scale. The company, he shared, wants to move as much of its production as possible into other parts of Europe.Denmark was already a leader in supporting Ukraine's arms output. It spearheads the \"Danish Model,\" an initiative to buy weapons directly from Ukrainian manufacturers rather than from other European or US firms. That weaponry reaches Ukraine faster and cheaper, without the backlogs plaguing Western producers.That model increased the production of key Ukrainian weaponry, like the 2S22 Bohdana 155mm howitzer, and it keeps growing. However, it's still in its early stages, unable, by itself, to close the gap that Ukraine is struggling to overcome and prompting Denmark and other partner nations to keep seeking additional solutions, like \"Build for Ukraine,\" that can operate alongside it.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Some volunteers were putting sandbags at beaches.\nThe National Weather Service placed New York City under a coastal flood warning and wind advisory through at least Monday afternoon. Coastal areas of suburban Long Island could see flooding, with up to 3 inches (about 8 centimeters) of rain and lashing winds expected, the weather service said.\nWind gusts of more than 30 mph (48 kph) were already being recorded in the region on Sunday morning.\nSome flight delays and cancellations were announced in airports from Washington, D.C. to Boston.\nThe storm was expected to move out by Monday night.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "content": "As the Middle East broadly welcomes a\u00a0ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war\u00a0in Gaza, Iran finds itself at one of its weakest moments since its 1979 Islamic Revolution.\nTehran has operated its self-described\u00a0\u201cAxis of Resistance\u201dover several decades, supporting militant groups and nations allied with it against Israel and the United States. But as Israel bombed the Gaza Strip, it also turned its crosshairs toward top leaders abroad in militant groups like Hamas, Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah and even the top echelon within Iran\u2019s military and nuclear program \u2014 killing many and disrupting their ability to fight back.\nAs\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0prepares for a Middle East trip that likely will see him praised by Israel and Arab nations, Iran won\u2019t be at the table as it still\u00a0struggles to recover from June\u2019s 12-day war.\nHow Tehran\u2019s theocracy responds in the weeks and months ahead, whether that means lashing out or trying to rebuild its hobbled economy at home, will be crucial.\n\u201cUndoubtedly this is a not a proud moment for Iran,\u201d said Ali Vaez, the Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. \u201cIts alliance system in the region is in ruins but it doesn\u2019t mean that the \u2018Axis of Resistance\u2019 is no more.\u201d\n\u2018Like a bankrupt gambler\u2019\nIranian state media has sought to describe the Gaza ceasefire as a victory for Hamas, despite the war destroying the Gaza Strip and killing over 67,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t differentiate between civilians and combatants but says around half the dead are women and children.\nIran\u2019s Foreign Ministry welcomed \u201cany decision \u2026 that guarantees halting the genocide of Palestinians.\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reiterated that on Saturday, telling state television that Hamas decided to accept the deal and that Tehran has \u201calways supported any plan, any action that led to the halt of crimes, genocide\u201d by Israel against the people of Gaza.\nBut perhaps more tellingly, an adviser to Iran\u2019s 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suggested the ceasefire would only lead to conflict elsewhere in the region.\n\u201cThe start of the ceasefire in Gaza may be the behind-the-scenes end of the ceasefire somewhere else!\u201d Ali Akbar Velayati, an adviser to Khamenei, wrote on X, referencing Hezbollah, Yemen\u2019s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels and Iraq.\nThe fear of further Israeli strikes, particularly on Iran, remains acute in the public\u2019s mind as much of Iranian\u00a0air defenses likely were destroyed by Israel in June. Khamenei has not resumed his usual routine of weekly speeches to audiences. Without explanation, Iran avoided holding a major military commemoration marking the end of the Iran-Iraq war in September, which typically sees top officials watch drones and missile launchers parade past them.\nIran\u2019s\u00a0economy also has suffered under international sanctions and as global energy prices fall.\n\u201cIran has always focused on its interests, we do not have resources anymore, our economy has weakened,\u201d said Tehran-based analyst Saeed Leilaz. \u201cOur support to Hamas was a reaction to U.S. to divert conflicts from our borders.\u201d\nOthers are less optimistic.\n\u201cIran is like a bankrupt gambler after winning some small money in the first rounds,\u201d said Amir Kazemi, a university student in Tehran. \u201cWhen Hamas attacked Israel, Iran was happy about it. But now, after the ceasefire, Iran finds nothing in its pocket.\u201d\nMideast looks far different\nIn the immediate years after\u00a0Iran\u2019s revolution, its theocratic government sought to export its Shiite revolutionary ideology more widely in the Middle East. That morphed following its devastating 1980s war with Iraq into more of an effort to provide a level of deterrence as Arab nations around it purchased sophisticated American bombs, warplanes and tanks that Tehran couldn\u2019t access due to sanctions.\nThe U.S. military\u2019s presence across the Persian Gulf also expanded following\u00a0the 1991 Gulf War, with Arab nations granting basing rights to American forces to Tehran\u2019s constant anger.\nThe peak of the \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d came in the chaotic years after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and Yemen\u2019s subsequent collapse into a civil war. Then, it could count on Hezbollah, Syrian autocrat Bashar Assad, the Houthis, Iraqi militant groups and even Hamas \u2014 a Sunni militant group.\nToday, the Mideast looks far different.\nIn Syria,\u00a0rebels overthrew Assad last year,\u00a0Israeli strikes killed Hezbollah and Hamas\u2019 top leaders, while Iraqi militant groups faded into the background. Yemen\u2019s Houthis, while still capable of launching attacks on Israel and\u00a0commercial shipping in the Red Sea corridor, find themselves now targeted by increasingly precise Israeli strikes.\nAnd the 12-day war in June left Iran likely no longer enriching uranium for its nuclear program, which\u00a0the West long has worried could be weaponized.\n\u2018Collapsing regional clout\u2019\nIran, meanwhile, has yet to receive any major support from either China or Russia, despite providing Beijing with likely discounted oil and Moscow with the drones it uses in its war on Ukraine. Tehran has also shied away from confronting\u00a0women who are increasingly abandoning the hijab, or headscarf, instead executing prisoners it already holds\u00a0at a rate unseen in decades.\n\u201cThe ceasefire is reflective of Tehran\u2019s collapsing regional clout following the unraveling of its long-powerful \u2018Axis of Resistance\u2019 since 2024,\u201d said Ali Fathollah-Nejad, the director of the Berlin-based Center for Middle East and Global Order. \u201cThe ceasefire will free Israeli military capacities that would now be used against Iranian interests \u2014 whether in Lebanon against Hezbollah or directly against Iran.\u201d\nFor his part, Trump seized on Iran accepting the ceasefire as \u201cterrific\u201d news. However, there\u2019s been no move toward renewed public negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program.\n\u201cTime is not on Iran\u2019s side but their problem is no one is really giving them an exit ramp,\u201d Vaez said. But whether Tehran would take the ramp also remains in question as its leaders still debate what turn to now take.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "description": "\u201cTo be clear, some of these cuts are going to be painful. This is not a situation that we relish.\"",
      "content": "Vice President JD Vance on Sunday said there will be deeper cuts to the federal workforce the longer the\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0goes on, adding to the uncertainty facing hundreds of thousands who are already furloughed without pay amid the stubborn stalemate in Congress.\nVance warned that as the federal shutdown entered its 12th day, the new cuts would be \u201cpainful,\u201d even as he said the Trump administration\u00a0worked to ensure\u00a0that the military is paid this week and some services would be preserved for low-income Americans,\u00a0including\u00a0food assistance.\nStill, hundreds of thousands of government workers have been furloughed in recent days and, in a\u00a0court filing\u00a0on Friday, the Office of Management and Budget said well over 4,000 federal employees would soon be fired in conjunction with the shutdown.\n\u201cThe longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be,\u201d Vance said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, some of these cuts are going to be painful. This is not a situation that we relish. This is not something that we\u2019re looking forward to, but the Democrats have dealt us a pretty difficult set of cards.\u201d\nLabor unions have already filed a lawsuit to stop the aggressive move by President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0\u2019s budget office, which goes far beyond what usually happens in a\u00a0government shutdown, further inflaming tensions between the Republicans who control Congress and the Democratic minority.\nThe shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The expiration of those subsidies at the end of the year will result in monthly cost increases for millions.\nTrump and Republican leaders have said they are open to negotiations on the health subsidies, but insist the government must reopen first.\nFor now, negotiations are virtually nonexistent. Dug in as ever, House leaders from both parties pointed fingers at each other in rival Sunday appearances on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\u201cWe have repeatedly made clear that we will sit down with anyone, anytime, anyplace,\u201d said House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. \u201cRepublicans control the House, the Senate and the presidency. It\u2019s unfortunate they\u2019ve taken a my-way-or-the-highway approach.\u201d\nHouse Speaker\u00a0Mike Johnson\u00a0blamed Democrats and said they \u201cseem not to care\u201d about the pain the shutdown is inflicting.\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying their best to distract the American people from the simple fact that they\u2019ve chosen a partisan fight so that they can prove to their Marxist rising base in the Democratic Party that they\u2019re willing to fight Trump and Republicans,\u201d he said.\nProgressive activists, meanwhile, expressed new support for the Democratic Party\u2019s position in the shutdown fight.\nEzra Levin, co-founder of the leading progressive protest group Indivisible, said he is \u201cfeeling good about the strength of Dem position.\u201d He pointed to fractures in the GOP, noting that Georgia Rep.\u00a0Marjorie Taylor Greene\u00a0publicly warned last week that health care insurance premiums would skyrocket for average Americans \u2014 including her own adult children \u2014 if nothing is done.\n\u201cTrump and GOP are rightfully taking the blame for the shutdown and for looming premium increases,\u201d Levin said. \u201cTheir chickens are coming home to roost.\u201d\nAnd yet the Republican administration and its congressional allies are showing no signs of caving to Democratic demands or backing away from threats to use the opportunity to pursue deeper cuts to the federal workforce.\nThousands of employees at the departments of Education, Treasury, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, are set to receive layoff notices, according to spokespeople for the agencies and union representatives for federal workers.\n\u201cYou hear a lot of Senate Democrats say, well, how can Donald Trump possibly lay off all of these federal workers?\u201d Vance said. \u201cWell, the Democrats have given us a choice between giving low-income women their food benefits and paying our troops on the one hand, and, on the other hand, paying federal bureaucrats.\u201d\nDemocrats say the firings are illegal and unnecessary.\n\u201cThey do not have to do this,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cThey do not have to punish people that shouldn\u2019t find themselves in this position.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-energy-taiwan-maanshan-plant",
      "source": "IEEE Spectrum",
      "description": "Taiwan failed to pass an August referendum on whether or not a nuclear plant should be restarted, if it were deemed safe to operate. While the more than 4 million votes for \u201cyes\u201d outnumbered the more than 1.5 million \u201cno\u201d votes, the number of affirmative votes failed to surpass the 25 percent threshold of eligible voters also required for the referendum to pass. As a result, Taiwan remains on the nuclear-free path it has followed since the shutdown of the nuclear plant in question, Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant, in southern Taiwan on 17 May, fulfilling a 2016 government pledge made as a result of Japan\u2019s 2011 Fukushima disaster.However, high-tech industries, including semiconductor manufacturing, AI data centers, and AI infrastructure operators, will continue fueling electricity demand. The question remains as to whether or not Taiwan can deliver reliable clean power to support the growth of these industries amid Chinese geopolitical pressure\u2014and without nuclear energy.Taiwan\u2019s Nuclear Energy DebateTaiwan\u2019s energy landscape remains complex. Nuclear power, developed since the 1970s, has seen older reactors retired since 2018. Taiwan imports 95 percent of its energy and has a growing reliance on natural gas. But it also aims to reduce carbon emissions, improve grid reliability, and expand its energy storage options.\u201cWithout energy, there\u2019s no industrial growth\u2026and nuclear is an excellent option,\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during a prereferendum visit to Taipei on 22 August. He met with key players in high-tech supply chains, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world\u2019s largest chip foundry producing advanced chips for smartphones, high-performance computing, and AI applications.It was not Huang\u2019s first time advocating for nuclear energy. During Computex Taipei in May he said, \u201cWe need energy from any single source: wind, solar, nuclear. Taiwan should absolutely invest in nuclear, and it shouldn\u2019t be a stigma to have energy.\u201dNvidia has been expanding in Taiwan, partnering with Foxconn and the government to build a 10,000-Blackwell GPU AI training and supercomputing facility in the south, opening a larger Taipei office, and collaborating with Taiwanese companies such as TSMC to build an AI infrastructure ecosystem.Taiwan president Lai Ching-te promised to honor the referendum result while focusing on diverse energy sources. He said Taiwan might consider advanced nuclear options if technology improves, waste decreases, and public support grows. In late August, the government approved a draft piece of legislation, the AI Basic Act, designed to create a supportive environment for AI development and use. The draft emphasizes the government\u2019s role in promoting AI research, applications, and infrastructure. Meanwhile, the newly reshuffled Cabinet is under pressure by industry and the broader public to maintain energy security.In mid-September, newly appointed Minister of Economic Affairs Ming-hsin Kung emphasized that Taiwan is a global hub for chips and technology, shaping strategies for the next 10 to 20 years.Taiwan\u2019s Renewable Energy GoalsKung stressed that businesses require both stable power supply and green energy to meet commitments to 100 percent renewable energy from global corporate initiative RE110. He said the new Cabinet will continue focusing on renewable energy while adjusting rollout speed. The goal is to lift renewables to 20 percent of Taiwan\u2019s power supply by the end of 2026\u2014a challenging target critical in keeping Taiwan competitive in global supply chains. He estimated renewable energy will account for around 15 percent of power generation by the end of 2025, up from 11.9 percent in 2024.  A wind turbine and its solar power system are part of the Taipower Exhibit Center in Pingtung, in southern Taiwan on 29 April 2025.I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty ImagesFor solar, Kung pledged to strengthen existing projects, resolve land-use conflicts with fish farms in solar-fishery initiatives, and replace older solar panels with newer ones that produce twice as much energy. Offshore wind construction will be accelerated, and a trial program for floating wind turbines will resume. Taiwan will also actively develop other green energy sources, such as geothermal and hydrogen.On nuclear, Kung reaffirmed Taiwan\u2019s nuclear-free path but left open the possibility of adopting advanced technologies like small modular reactors. Guidelines for evaluating potential restarts of existing plants will be released by the end of October. The first step will see the Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) conducting assessments of all three halted nuclear plants, with initial results due next year. Maanshan, which began commercial operations in 1984, is regarded as the most likely to pass the safety self-assessments, which will focus on the ability to maintain aging equipment and upgrade earthquake resilience.In a report released on 26 September, Taiwan\u2019s Energy Administration projects electricity demand to grow 1.7 percent annually from 2025 to 2034. The forecast factors in expansions to Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor industry, investments in AI development, and expected energy savings.To meet rising power demand, the government currently plans to boost natural-gas generation while phasing out large nuclear, coal, and oil plants. Net additions of 12.2 gigawatts in gas-fired capacity are expected by 2034.Semiconductor Industry ConcernsBut high-tech industries express concern. In early September, at Semicon Taiwan, Charles Lee, the managing director of Topco Group, a major semiconductor supplier, told IEEE Spectrum that manufacturers worry about grid stability as AI and semiconductor growth accelerates. \u201cHighly polluting coal-fired plants are no longer an option, so we will rely more on liquefied natural gas and less-stable renewables. If nuclear plants could be restarted, I would personally welcome it,\u201d Lee says.Meanwhile, a memory manufacturing director, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he isn\u2019t authorized by his company to speak to the media, told Spectrum that Taiwan\u2019s economy is still manufacturing-driven. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the low efficiency of green energy. We\u2019ve also noticed a trend abroad, with countries resuming nuclear plant construction,\u201d he says.In a televised debate ahead of the August referendum, Tzu-Hsien Tung, chairman of Pegatron Corp., voiced support for restarting nuclear power plants. He warned that if Taiwan continues to rely on carbon-heavy electricity, local firms could face steep carbon taxes overseas, undermining their global competitiveness.  Visitors view AI server samples at the Zhen Ding Tech Group booth during the Semicon Taiwan exhibition in Taipei on 10 September 2025.I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty ImagesAs Taiwanese society debated whether to restart nuclear power plants, some Taiwanese energy experts, including Tze-Luen Lin, deputy executive director of the Taiwanese government\u2019s Office of Energy and Carbon Reduction and a political science professor at National Taiwan University, have called for fresh approaches to Taiwan\u2019s energy resilience amid ongoing Chinese threats, echoing to notions brought by nongovernmental organizations and think thanks, such as the U.S.-based Center for Climate and Security, that a clean-energy transition can strengthen national security.At the Society for Environmental Economics and Policy Studies conference in Japan on 21 September, Lin highlighted that renewable energy is central to both energy and national security. He emphasized, \u201cEnergy resilience can only be strengthened through decentralized, locally sourced renewables, combined with microgrids and energy storage,\u201d and warned that large, centralized power plants are easier targets for attack.Commenting on Taiwan\u2019s possible nuclear options, Jusen Asuka, a professor at Tohoku University and chair of the session in the conference, cautioned that small modular reactors remain immature and costly, and investing heavily in them could slow renewable-energy development.",

      "content": "2024 Election\nAfter An Eventful Month, Trump Has Lost Support In The GOP Primary\nBut he still has a dominant lead.\n\n\n\nBy Nathaniel Rakich\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAug. 31, 2023, at 6:00 AM\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\tFormer President Donald Trump steps off his plane as he arrives in Atlanta to be booked at the Fulton County Jail.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAP Photo/Alex Brandon\n\n\n\n\nOnce more, with feeling: It has been a couple of weeks since former President Donald Trump\u2019s latest indictment (this time in Georgia, in connection with his efforts to overturn the 2020 election there). Do the charges appear to have affected his chances of returning to the White House?\nAfter each of Trump\u2019s three prior indictments, his polling numbers changed in small, inconsistent ways \u2014 if they changed at all. The fourth indictment followed this non-pattern pattern: Some evidence suggests that he\u2019s gained ground in the Republican primary, other evidence suggests that he\u2019s lost it, and what little general-election data we have suggests nothing has shifted significantly. And, adding to the frustration of political junkies everywhere, it\u2019s very difficult to figure out how much the fourth indictment affected Trump\u2019s standing in the race given how close it occurred to two other major events on the campaign trail: the third indictment and the GOP presidential debate.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s take a deeper look at national polls of the Republican primary. There have been 29 of these conducted completely after news of the fourth indictment broke late at night on Aug. 14, and Trump has fallen from 53 percent in our polling average to 50 percent since then.9 But the Georgia indictment came on the heels of another big set of charges: On Aug. 1, Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury, also for allegedly interfering with the 2020 election. And only five combinations of pollsters and sponsors conducted polls both in the period between the two indictments (Aug. 1 and Aug. 14) and after the Georgia one (since Aug. 14).10 That\u2019s important because, while we can theoretically compare, say, Emerson College\u2019s Aug. 16-17 survey to its June 19-20 survey, it would be impossible to say that Trump\u2019s 3-percentage-point decline is due to the Georgia indictment. It could have been due to the third indictment, or any other combination of events that occurred over those two months.11\nThen, to make matters even more complicated, only two of those pollsters wrapped their post-indictment poll before the Aug. 23 Republican presidential debate, which also could have shifted views of Trump. And those two disagree about how much the race shifted after the indictment. According to Morning Consult, Trump\u2019s national support among potential primary voters barely budged, from 57 percent to 58 percent. But according to Premise, Trump actually boosted his numbers among Republican registered voters over this period, from 54 percent to 60 percent.\nThat\u2019s not what we see when we look at Trump\u2019s average support, which has decreased \u2014 but that may be linked to the debate, which Trump declined to attend. According to three pairs of polls12 whose first half was fielded after the indictment but before the debate and whose second half was fielded after the debate, Trump\u2019s national support dropped by an average of 4 points. In addition, a FiveThirtyEight/Washington Post/Ipsos poll conducted using Ipsos\u2019s KnowledgePanel found that 5 percent of Republican likely voters who watched the debate were considering voting for Trump before it but not after it, making him the only candidate to lose a significant amount of potential support.\nIt doesn\u2019t look like the fourth indictment changed many minds among the general electorate either. Morning Consult and Premise were again the only two pollsters to ask about a hypothetical general-election matchup between Trump and President Biden during our windows of interest (Aug. 1-14 for the before poll, Aug. 15-23 for the after poll). According to Premise, registered voters preferred Trump to Biden by 4 points before the indictment and by 5 points after it \u2014 not a statistically significant shift. And according to Morning Consult, the results were the same (Biden 43 percent, Trump 41 percent) before and after the Georgia indictment. \nOne more pollster/sponsor pairing \u2014 Ipsos/ABC News \u2014 asked about Trump\u2019s overall favorable and unfavorable ratings both before and after the indictment. In their Aug. 2-3 poll, 30 percent of American adults viewed him favorably, and 59 percent viewed him unfavorably. And in their Aug. 15-16 poll, 31 percent viewed him favorably and 55 percent viewed him unfavorably. That seems like an improvement, but it was within the poll\u2019s margin of error, so it could just be noise.\nTo be sure, a measly three polls conducted 15 months before the election are not the final word on Trump\u2019s fate in the court of public opinion. The case against Trump in Georgia (really, all of his indictments) could hurt or help him more as time drags on, particularly if he is convicted or acquitted before the election. It\u2019s also possible that this entire exercise is flawed, given that the \u201cbefore\u201d polls in this analysis all came within two weeks of Trump\u2019s third indictment; perhaps Trump\u2019s polling numbers in this period were already depressed because of those (similar) allegations.\nBut looking at the big picture \u2014 including FiveThirtyEight\u2019s averages of the national Republican primary and Trump\u2019s overall favorable and unfavorable ratings \u2014 it\u2019s clear that public opinion about Trump has not changed in a major way in several months, even after he was indicted on nearly 100 criminal charges in four different jurisdictions. After what is expected to be his final indictment, he remains the strong favorite in the GOP primary and a competitive candidate in the general election.\nCORRECTION (Aug. 31, 2023, 8:37 a.m.): An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that former President Donald Trump\u2019s support in our national Republican primary polling average was 50 percent when news of his indictment in Georgia broke on Aug. 14. In fact, it was 53 percent.",

Bitcoin fell by more than 10 per cent to below $110,000, before recovering to $113,096 on Saturday morning. The value of Ethereum slumped by 11.2 per cent to $3,878. Other cryptocurrencies, including XRP, Doge and Ada, fell around 19 per cent, 27 per cent, and 25 per cent in the last 24 hours, respectively.\n \n\nLiveMint shares some statistics from Bloomberg:\n\nCiting 24-hour data from Coinglass, the report noted that more than $19 billion has been wiped out in the \"largest liquidation event in crypto history\", which impacted more than 1.6 million traders. It added that more than $7 billion of those positions were sold in less than one hour of trading on October 10. According to data on CoinMarketCap, the cryptocurrency market cap has dived to $3.74 trillion from the record-high $4.30 trillion level, the previous day. Trading volumes as of the market close were recorded at $490.23 billion. \n\nBitcoin retreated on Friday, as US-China trade tensions reignited, after racing to record highs earlier in the week as persistent rate-cut bets and signs of some cooling in geopolitical tensions helped boost risk. Bitcoin was trading at $105,505.4 on Friday, down 13.15% on the day.\n\n\n\nRead more of this story at Slashdot.",

On Tuesday, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy announced that he\u2019s directing three House committees to start investigating whether President Biden benefited from his son Hunter\u2019s business dealings overseas. McCarthy accused the Biden family of \u201ca culture of corruption,\u201d saying that the Biden administration gave Hunter \u201cspecial treatment\u201d in a criminal tax and gun investigation, and that Biden himself had lied about his knowledge of his son\u2019s financial dealings.\nThe good news for McCarthy and the right-wing supporters of an impeachment investigation is that Americans do seem to believe, overall, that Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings were sketchy at best and illegal at worst.\nBut Hunter Biden isn\u2019t the subject of the impeachment inquiry \u2014 his father is. So far, Republicans haven\u2019t provided any concrete evidence tying the president to his son\u2019s overseas business, although the impeachment inquiry may allow House Republicans to obtain bank records and other financial documents from Biden and his son. Right now, Republicans are most firmly convinced that Biden is implicated in Hunter\u2019s wrongdoing, while Americans overall are more inclined to see former President Donald Trump\u2019s family as corrupt, compared to the Bidens. And there isn\u2019t a broad consensus that an impeachment inquiry is warranted, signaling that Republicans have some convincing to do if they want the public to support their investigation.\nAmericans think Hunter Biden profited from his father\u2019s position\nAll of the allegations of a broader web of corruption within the Biden family have yet to be proven. What is less disputed, though, is the fact that Hunter Biden has personally made a significant amount of money through overseas business deals, and is the subject of a long-running criminal investigation. Earlier this summer, he agreed to plead guilty to two misdemeanor counts of failing to pay taxes on millions of dollars of income in 2017 and 2018, with an additional agreement that could allow him to avoid a conviction on a separate illegal gun ownership charge, but the plea deal fell apart after the judge, a Trump appointee, said she refused to \u201crubber-stamp\u201d the agreement, which she said wasn\u2019t standard. Republicans accused the Biden administration of giving Hunter a \u201csweetheart\u201d deal and in August, Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel to continue probing Hunter Biden\u2019s finances.\nNone of this is a great look for the president\u2019s son, and recent polling shows that Americans are unhappy about Hunter Biden\u2019s behavior. A YouGov/The Economist poll conducted in August, after the plea deal collapsed, found that 72 percent of Americans think Hunter Biden personally profited from his father\u2019s positions in government, including a slim majority (53 percent) of Democrats. The same poll found that two-thirds (66 percent) of Americans have an unfavorable view of Hunter Biden, while only 17 percent have a favorable view (an additional 17 percent said they didn\u2019t know). According to a Yahoo News survey conducted by YouGov in August, 59 percent of Americans think Hunter Biden traded on his family name and proximity to power to get millions of dollars from foreign business associates. The same poll found that 51 percent of Americans believe that Hunter Biden improperly claimed tens of thousands of dollars in tax deductions. And an Ipsos/Politico Magazine poll conducted in August found, similarly, that 59 percent of Americans think that Hunter Biden is guilty of the alleged crimes in the tax non-payment case, including 51 percent of Democrats. Notably, only 2 percent of respondents said they thought he wasn\u2019t guilty, and 38 percent said they didn\u2019t know.\nThe YouGov/Economist poll\u2019s findings suggest, though, that Americans think most presidents\u2019 children get some level of special treatment. The survey found that 84 percent of respondents think children of U.S. presidents get away with things that other people do not because of their parents\u2019 jobs, and a similar share (85 percent) say that adult children personally profit from their parents\u2019 positions in government at least sometimes. So while Americans do seem convinced, overall, that Hunter Biden has profited financially from his father\u2019s jobs, and even a slim majority of Democrats think he likely committed crimes, the behavior may not be shocking or unexpected.\nRepublicans are more convinced that Biden is implicated in Hunter\u2019s wrongdoing\nRepublicans don\u2019t really have to convince Americans that Hunter Biden deserves investigation, or even a criminal trial. But that\u2019s not the question that matters for impeaching his father. To justify impeaching the president, Republicans will have to prove that he was involved in financial wrongdoing or corruption that rises to the level of an impeachable offense. And so far, Republicans are making claims without facts to back them up. When he announced the inquiry, McCarthy asserted \u2014 without evidence \u2014 that the millions Hunter Biden earned through overseas deals were also improperly shared with Biden family members, and that Biden used his official role as vice president to help get business for Hunter. \nMore findings that tie Biden and his family to Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings could, of course, emerge. But right now, Americans haven\u2019t fully bought into the idea that the Biden family is involved in a broader influence-peddling scheme. Less than half (41 percent) of respondents in the Yahoo poll said they believe that Hunter Biden funneled millions of dollars to his father in a long-running scheme to help Joe Biden profit off his position, while 26 percent said they didn\u2019t believe it and 33 percent said they didn\u2019t know. A similar share (44 percent) believe that Biden definitely or probably did something illegal regarding Hunter Biden, while 32 percent believe he definitely or probably did not and 32 percent said they don\u2019t know.\nMany Americans are not very tuned in to the allegations against the Bidens, which is probably why these questions result in such a high share of people who say they don\u2019t know. And another recent poll found a slightly higher share of people who say that even if Joe Biden didn\u2019t do something illegal, he may have acted unethically. According to an SSRS/CNN poll conducted in August, 61 percent of Americans agreed that Biden had at least some involvement in Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings, although less than half (42 percent) said he acted illegally and 18 percent said he acted unethically but not illegally. Similarly, a Quinnipiac University poll conducted in September found that 35 percent of Americans thought Biden was involved and did something illegal in Hunter Biden\u2019s business dealings with Ukraine and China, while 14 percent think he was involved and did something unethical but not illegal, and 37 percent think he wasn\u2019t involved.\n\n  Republicans are most convinced of the Bidens\u2019 wrongdoing Share of respondents who said they believe that Hunter Biden did each of the following things, by party affiliation      All Democrats Republicans Independents     Traded on his family name and proximity to power to get millions of dollars from foreign business associates 59 37 88 63   Failed to meet tax filing deadlines 59 50 78 57   Improperly claimed tens of thousands of dollars in tax deductions 51 31 81 51   Got preferential treatment from federal prosecutors when striking a plea deal 51 22 86 56   Funneled millions of dollars to his father in a long-running scheme to help Joe Biden profit off of his position 41 10 84 41     Source: YouGov/Yahoo News \n\nBut as the table above shows, the people who really believe that the Biden family is corrupt are Republicans. Unsurprisingly, Democrats are much less convinced that the president did something wrong, and independents are also pretty divided. Of course, it\u2019s possible that more coverage of the allegations motivating the impeachment inquiry \u2014 and any concrete evidence that might get turned up along the way \u2014 could change people\u2019s minds, or at least persuade\u00a0 some of the ones who are undecided.\u00a0\nAnd notably, the Yahoo News survey found that while the share of Americans \u2014 including the share of Democrats \u2014 who think Hunter Biden did something illegal has increased since last fall, the share of respondents who think Joe Biden broke the law has remained functionally unchanged, despite a drumbeat of Republican accusations to the contrary. Polling by Beacon Research/Shaw & Co. Research for Fox News has found a similar trend: The share of Americans who think Hunter Biden did something illegal rose from 39 percent last December to 50 percent in August, but the share of Americans who think Joe Biden did something illegal related to his son\u2019s business dealings hasn\u2019t really moved. (The survey found it at 35 percent in December versus 38 percent in August.)\nAmericans aren\u2019t convinced impeachment is warranted\nPerhaps most worryingly for Republicans, most Americans don\u2019t think an impeachment inquiry into Biden is warranted right now. A GBAO/Fabrizio, Lee & Associates poll for The Wall Street Journal conducted in late August found that 52 percent of Americans oppose impeaching Biden, and only 41 percent are in favor. More recently, a YouGov poll conducted on September 13 found that 41 percent of Americans oppose impeaching Biden, 44 percent are in support and 15 percent don\u2019t know. In early October 2019, when Trump\u2019s first impeachment was getting underway, Americans were more closely divided, according to our polling tracker. And in the wake of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, majorities of Americans supported Trump\u2019s impeachment; a slim majority of Americans even consistently supported removing Trump from office before the end of his term.\nIn fact, allegations of corruption are stickier when it comes to the Trump family than the Bidens. According to the Yahoo News survey, 46 percent of Americans think that Trump and his family are more corrupt than the Bidens, while 36 percent think the Bidens are more corrupt than the Trumps. And a recent AP-NORC poll found that Americans were more likely to describe Trump as \u201ccorrupt\u201d than Biden. Meanwhile, that September YouGov poll found that Americans are more likely to describe the impeachment inquiry as motivated by politics in an attempt to embarrass Biden (41 percent) rather than a serious effort to find out the truth (28 percent).\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that Hunter Biden\u2019s legal troubles aren\u2019t a liability for Biden, particularly after a grand jury just indicted him on federal gun charges. A recent Emerson College poll found that while 47 of voters say that the indictments against Trump make them less likely to vote for him for president, 46 percent say the Hunter Biden tax and felony gun charges make them less likely to vote for Joe Biden in 2024. So it\u2019s possible that as Hunter Biden\u2019s investigation continues to unfold, his father could take political damage. But right now, Republicans aren\u2019t just missing evidence that Biden is connected to his son\u2019s wrongdoing in ways that could be impeachable \u2014 they also don\u2019t have the public on their side.\nOther polling bites:\n\nAmericans are concerned about aging political leaders, and a significant chunk want to see age limits for high-profile national politicians, according to a new poll from Civiqs for Daily Kos. The survey found that 74 percent want a mandatory retirement age for U.S. senators, 67 percent want a retirement age for Supreme Court justices, and 58 percent want a retirement age for presidents.\nAfter the Food & Drug Administration approved two new boosters for COVID-19, a CivicScience poll found that a majority (52 percent) of Americans said they\u2019re at least somewhat likely to get the new COVID vaccine, while 59 percent said they\u2019re at least somewhat likely to get a flu vaccine.\nFertility treatments are getting more common \u2013 according to a newly released April poll from the Pew Research Center, 42 percent of adults say they have either gotten fertility treatments or know someone who has, up from 33 percent just five years ago.\n\nBiden approval\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s presidential approval tracker,1 40.9 percent of Americans approve of the job Biden is doing as president, while 54.4 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -13.5 points). At this time last week, 40.0 percent approved and 56.0 percent disapproved (a net approval rating of -16.0 points). One month ago, Biden had an approval rating of 40.8 percent and a disapproval rating of 54.5 percent, for a net approval rating of -13.8 points.\nCORRECTION (Sept. 18, 2023, 11:20 a.m.): A previous version of this article stated that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy asserted, without evidence, that Hunter Biden shared some of the money he received through foreign deals with his family. In fact, there is evidence that Hunter Biden\u2019s family members also received money through these deals, but in his announcement, McCarthy did not offer evidence that it was illegal or corrupt.",

      "description": "\"California Governor Gavin Newsom signed the 'California Opt Me Out Act', which will require web browsers to include an easy, universal way for users to opt out of data collection and sales,\" reports the blog 9to5Mac:\n\n\n[The law] requires browsers to provide a clear, one-click mechanism for Californians to opt out of data sharing across websites. The bill reads: \"A business shall not develop or maintain a browser that does not include functionality configurable by a consumer that enables the browser to send an opt-out preference signal to businesses with which the consumer interacts through the browser....\"\nCalifornians will need patience, though, as the law doesn't take effect until January 1, 2027.\n \n\nAmericans in some states \u2014 including California, Texas, Colorado, New Jersey and Maryland \u2014 \"have the option to make those opt-out demands automatic whenever they surf the web,\" reports the Washington Post. \"But they can only do so if they use small browsers that voluntarily offer that option, such as DuckDuckGo, Firefox and Brave. What's new in California's law is that all browsers must give people the same option.\"\n That means soon in California, just using Google's Chrome, Apple's Safari and Microsoft's Edge can command companies not to sell your data or pass it along for ad targeting... It's an imperfect but potent and simple way to flex privacy rights \u2014 and becomes even more powerful with another simple privacy measure in California. Starting on January 1, California residents can fill out an online form once to completely and repeatedly wipe their data from hundreds of data brokers that package your personal information for sale. \nBut their article also suggests other ways readers can \"try a one-click privacy option now.\"\n\n\"[S]ome national companies respect one-click privacy opt-out requests from everyone... This happens automatically if you use DuckDuckGo and Brave. You need to change a setting with Firefox.\"\n\"Download Privacy Badger: The software from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a consumer privacy advocacy group, works in the background to order websites not to sell information they're collecting about you.\"\n\"Use Permission Slip from Consumer Reports. Give the app basic information, and it will help you do much of the legwork to tell companies not to sell your information or to delete it, if you have the right to do so.\"\n\n\nRead more of this story at Slashdot.",

      "description": "About 56,000 U.S. purchase agreements were canceled in August, representing 15.1% of homes that went under contract that month, Redfin said.",
      "content": "It\u2019s a buyer\u2019s market, and that means house hunters are walking away from contracts more frequently, according to data from Redfin. Sellers outnumber buyers in the housing market by about 500,000, the real-estate firm said, as it found that buyers are wielding more negotiating leverage and asking sellers to cover the cost of any repairs that need to be done and demanding price cuts.\nAt the same time, many sellers are not accommodating the concerns of would-be buyers, who have become pickier and are seeking more concessions.\nAbout 56,000 U.S. purchase agreements were canceled in August, representing 15.1% of homes that went under contract. That\u2019s the highest share for August deals falling through in records dating back to 2017. It\u2019s also up from 14.3% in August 2024 and well above the post-pandemic housing frenzy\u2019s rate of 11.4% in August 2021.\n\u201cHome purchases are falling through more frequently because buyers and sellers oftentimes aren\u2019t on the same page and aren\u2019t willing to compromise,\u201d Redfin said in its report.\nIn a survey of Redfin\u2019s real estate agents, 70.4% said home inspection or repair issues were the cause of canceled contracts\u2014by far the top reason.\nThat was followed by 27.8% who said buyer financing fell through, 21% who said buyers were unable to sell their current homes, 14.9% who cited changes in a buyer\u2019s financial situation, and 12.9% who said a buyer had found another house they preferred.\nRedfin\nIn addition, many of the cities with the highest cancelation rates were in Florida and Texas, which have seen a surge in housing supply after a pandemic-era exodus to those states triggered a building boom.\nMeanwhile, sellers still think their homes will command high asking prices like they did during the housing bonanza in 2020 and 2021, or they paid so much for their properties and aren\u2019t not willing to budge on the price.\nA new reality for sellers\n\u201cSome are having a hard time adjusting to the reality that it\u2019s no longer a seller\u2019s market because it seems like just yesterday that homes were getting dozens of offers and fetching tens of thousands of dollars over the asking price,\u201d Redfin said. \nThe report also pointed out that lower-priced homes are in greater demand because overall homeownership costs have jumped in recent years, and those homes are more likely to have issues come up during inspections.\nInsurance premiums have surged in states like Florida and California that have seen more natural disasters, contributing to the increase in ownership costs.\nMeanwhile, mortgage rates remain high despite coming down since the Federal Reserve lowered benchmark borrowing costs.\nIn fact, pending home sales actually fell in September, the first time in nearly three months, even as the weekly average mortgage rate dropped for nine consecutive weeks.\nAmid the weak demand, home sales are headed for their worst year since 1995 as economic concerns spread from buyers to sellers. A\u00a0Fannie Mae\u00a0survey earlier this month showed nearly 70% of Americans believe the economy is headed in the wrong direction, and 73% think it\u2019s a bad time to buy a house.\u00a0\nGiven all the anxiety, sometimes sellers who are willing to accommodate buyers\u2019 demands still can\u2019t overcome their cold feet.\n\u201cI worked with one seller who received 78 repair requests from a buyer following the inspection, and that was after the seller had already agreed to lower their $375,000 asking price by $25,000 because the house needed some improvements,\u201d said\u00a0Dawn Liedtke, a Redfin real estate agent in Tampa. \u201cThe buyer came back and said they would handle the cost of the repairs, but only if the seller was willing to lower the price by another $100,000. The deal didn\u2019t work out.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "content": "The UK Government has quietly posted a six-figure job ad not for a policy expert or border agent, but for a communications lead whose main mission is to make the public believe Labour is tackling immigration. Think: Less Border Force, more brand management.\nAs per the job advert, which was posted two weeks ago on LinkedIn, the Deputy Director Migration Communications role is key to \u201ckeeping the streets safe and borders secure.\u201d\u00a0\nFor up to $120,000 (\u00a391,000) the candidate will be expected to help \u201cthe department to spot and mitigate risks and deliver attitude and behaviour change that ultimately supports the security and economic prosperity of the UK.\u201d\nThe successful candidate will also see a generous employer contribution to their pension of 28.97%. But they\u2019ll need to come equipt with an ability to navigate crises, influence Ministers, and drive behaviour change across a highly complex, controversial, and high-stakes area of public service.\nA big\u2014and controversial\u2014job awaits the government\u2019s new hire\nFrom brands to billionaires, storytellers are still in demand\u2014despite what the headlines say about AI taking over all marketing and copywriting jobs.\nAnd one of the key messages, whoever lands the migration communications role will have to drive home, is that the government is reducing the number of illegal immigrants, including those crossing the Channel in small boats.\nThey\u2019ll have their work cut out for them. The Telegraph reports that more than 1,000 migrants arrived on 15 small boats within a single day last week, pushing this year\u2019s total to 35,476\u2014up 33% from the same period in 2024. That pace mirrors the record-breaking levels of 2022, when roughly 45,000 people crossed the Channel under the Conservative government.\nA Home Office source stressed to The Telegraph that the position was not newly created, and posted due to a staff change\u2014rather than a change in approach. However, in the report, the Conservatives have questioned whether the position will actually make a difference, while suggesting that the new hire is a PR stunt.\n\u201cInstead of stopping illegal immigration they are hiring people to try cover it up,\u201d Shadow Home Secretary Chris Philp said.\nThe successful candidate will also have to face the public court of approval. Some social media users were quick to slam the job listing as a waste of taxpayer money and government \u201cpropaganda.\u201d\n\u201cIn other words to create misinformation as \u2018truth\u2019 and calm you down,\u201d one person wrote on X.\n\u201cInstead of fixing an issue they\u2019d rather spend \u00a390k to gaslight you into believing they\u2019ve fixed it,\u201d another added.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "title": "The AI Boom Has a Copper Problem. Are Microbes the",
      "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/ai-copper",
      "source": "IEEE Spectrum",
      "description": "The internet\u2019s next existential crisis won\u2019t be disinformation or deepfakes. It will be copper.The world is building AI like it\u2019s Minecraft, stacking data centers, transmission lines, and cooling systems with little regard for the physical limits beneath them. Everyone is focused on models and computation, but few acknowledge the metal that makes them run.Every piece of modern electrical infrastructure\u2014not just AI\u2014depends on copper. AI data centers are simply accelerating demand. One hyperscale facility can require tens of thousands of tonnes of copper. For example, one Microsoft data center used over 2,000 tonnes, or 27 tonnes per megawatt. A McKinsey report predicts that overall transmission build-out could push annual global copper demand up to about 37 million tonnes by 2031. Accessible copper is running out. More than 70 percent of global reserves are locked in ores that conventional mining struggles to process efficiently. Tens of billions of tons sit idle in waste piles and marginal deposits, overlooked by industry but still rich with potential.That potential is what drew me here. As a geoscientist who later worked in energy and cloud infrastructure, I saw firsthand the growing need for copper\u2014and realized I had the knowledge to help address it. In 2023, I founded a startup called Endolith to recover copper from these forgotten sources. The tool is not drills or dynamite. It\u2019s microbes.How microbial mining worksThese microbes are naturally evolved, field-deployable, and highly effective at recovering copper from complex ores such as chalcopyrite and enargite. They thrive in leaching heaps under real-world conditions, working with real customers. And the bonus: They use less energy, deliver more copper, and have a smaller environmental footprint than traditional methods.And what are those traditional methods? Typically, mines extract copper from ores by grinding the rock, concentrating the ore, and then using high-temperature smelting or chemical leaching with strong acids. Both approaches are energy-intensive, slow to unlock copper, and leave behind large volumes of waste and emissions.  Endolith researchers use machine learning to determine which microbes to deploy at a given site and how to adjust the mix over time. Dynamic Tech Media/EndolithIn contrast, our \u201cmicrobial minions\u201d work by accelerating the natural process of bioleaching. Instead of relying on smelting or harsh acids, Endolith\u2019s microbes attach to the ore and pull out the copper faster. They adapt to the chemistry of different rock types, recover more metal, and do it with lower energy use and less environmental impact.To make this possible, we rely on machine learning. Genomic and metabolic data from thousands of microbes are modeled to predict which strains can survive in extreme ores such as chalcopyrite or enargite, and how they will perform under different environmental conditions. These models guide which microbial communities are deployed, how they are tuned for each site, and how they adapt over time. In effect, AI is what turns biology from trial-and-error into a scalable system for copper recovery; in turn, that copper is what keeps powering the growth of AI itself.  Endolith is currently running a pilot project in Arvada, Colorado.Dynamic Tech Media/EndolithOur approach has already been validated by some of the largest copper producers in the world, including BHP. Microbial recovery is cleaner. It scales. It adapts. Our modular biohatcheries\u2014field units designed to grow and deliver tailored microbes\u2014can be deployed in days. They can be tuned for local conditions. They make copper recovery viable on deposits that were previously left untouched. This tool opens access to a part of the supply chain that mining has overlooked and technology has rarely considered.The copper crunch is slowing down AIConversations about AI infrastructure rarely address this layer. Computing costs and energy needs dominate the narrative, yet copper underpins the entire system.  Liz Dennett founded Endolith to recover much-needed copper from low-grade ore. Dynamic Tech Media/EndolithThe physical side of AI is often hidden from view. Its presence becomes obvious when a data center project is delayed because a transformer cannot be delivered on time, or when utilities cannot build transmission lines quickly enough to support new computing loads. These are copper problems, hiding in plain sight.I have had calls with site engineers who are excited about deploying cutting-edge computing, but are quietly worried about whether the wiring can handle it. Infrastructure does not automatically follow because the software is ready. Copper is bound by geology and time. Mines move slowly, recycling moves too narrowly, and demand moves too fast. Smarter biological recovery is the lever we can pull today.Skeptics note that bioleaching has historically struggled with tough ores like chalcopyrite. Processes were often slow, incomplete, or difficult to manage at scale. Recent advances in microbial science and heap engineering are closing those gaps. With AI guiding the optimization of microbes, we can now match the right strains to the right ores, showing that biology can succeed where older methods fell short.Too often, technology assumes the material world will keep pace with ambition. But ambition alone cannot dig rock from the ground\u2014and it definitely cannot create copper. I see a disconnect between belief and infrastructure. We believe this future is coming, but the physical systems required to support it are decades behind. If we want to build something durable, we need more than ambition and venture capital. We need metal, and we need smarter pathways to extract it.If we want to keep building, we need to be clear about what we are building with. That means extraction, wiring, and chemistry\u2014the parts of the system that rarely make headlines but determine whether progress is possible.The AI era will not be sustained by excitement. It will be sustained by copper. And the next leap in recovery may come from microbes\u2026tiny, ancient, and alive.",

In opening remarks, acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy highlighted the five-year anniversary of the Artemis Accords next month.\n\u201cWhen President Trump launched the Artemis Accords in his first term, he made sure American values would lead the way \u2013 bringing together a coalition of nations to set the rules of the road in space and ensure exploration remains peaceful. After five years, the coalition is stronger than ever. This is critical as we seek to beat China to the Moon, not just to leave footprints, but this time to stay,\u201d said Duffy.\nThe United States, led by NASA and the U.S. Department of State, signed the accords on Oct. 13, 2020, with seven other founding nations. The accords were created in response to the growing global interest in lunar activities by governments and private companies. They now comprise 56 country signatories \u2014 nearly 30% of the world\u2019s countries.\nThe event was co-chaired by NASA, the Australian Space Agency, and the UAE Space Agency. Dozens of nations were represented, creating the foundation for future space exploration for the Golden Age of exploration and innovation.\n\u201cAustralia is a proud founding signatory of the Artemis Accords and is focused on supporting new signatories in the Indo-Pacific region,\u201d said Head of Australian Space Agency Enrico Palermo. \u201cThe purpose of the accords is as important \u2014 if not more important \u2014 as it was when first established. This annual gathering of principals at IAC 2025 is a key opportunity to reaffirm our collective commitment to exploring the Moon, Mars and beyond in a peaceful, safe, and sustainable way.\u201d\nDuring the meeting, leaders discussed recommendations for non-interference in each other\u2019s space activities including transparency on expected launch dates, general nature of activities, and landing locations.\u00a0They also discussed orbital debris mitigation and disposal management, interoperability of systems for safer and more efficient operations, and the release of scientific data.\nIn May 2025, the United Arab Emirates hosted an Artemis Accords workshop focused on topics, such as non-interference and space object registration and reporting beyond Earth orbit.\n\u201cThrough our active participation in the Artemis Accords and by organizing specialised workshops, we aim to reinforce the principles of transparency, sustainability, and innovation in space activities. We are committed to strengthening international partnerships and facilitating the exchange of expertise, thereby contributing to the development of a robust global framework for safe and responsible space exploration, while opening new frontiers for scientific research,\u201d said UAE Minister of Sports and Chairman of UAE Space Agency Ahmad Belhoul Al Falasi. \u201cThis reflects the UAE\u2019s unwavering commitment to enhancing international cooperation in space exploration and promoting the peaceful use of space.\u201d\nMore countries are expected to sign the Artemis Accords in the months and years ahead, as NASA continues its work to establish a safe, peaceful, and prosperous future in space.\nLearn more about the Artemis Accords at:\nhttps://www.nasa.gov/artemis-accords\n-end-\nBethany Stevens / Elizabeth ShawHeadquarters, Washington202-358-1600bethany.c.stevens@nasa.gov\u00a0/\u00a0elizabeth.a.shaw@nasa.gov\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetails\n\n\n\nLast Updated\n\nSep 30, 2025\n\nLocationNASA Headquarters \n\nRelated TermsArtemis AccordsArtemisOffice of International and Interagency Relations (OIIR)",

      "description": "Cryptologist/CS professor Daniel J. Bernstein is alleging that America's National Security Agency is attempting to influence NIST post-quantum cryptography standards. \n\nBernstein first emphasizes that it's normal for post-quantum cryptography (or \"PQ\") to be part of \"hybrid\" security that also includes traditional pre-quantum cryptography. (Bernstein says this is important because since 2016, \"We've seen many breaks of post-quantum proposals...\") \n\n\"The problem in a nutshell. Surveillance agency NSA and its [UK counterpart] GCHQ are trying to have standards-development organizations endorse weakening [pre-quantum] ECC+PQ down to just PQ.\"\nPart of this is that NSA and GCHQ have been endlessly repeating arguments that this weakening is a good thing... I'm instead looking at how easy it is for NSA to simply spend money to corrupt the standardization process.... The massive U.S. military budget now publicly requires cryptographic \"components\" to have NSA approval... In June 2024, NSA's William Layton wrote that \"we do not anticipate supporting hybrid in national security systems\"... \n\n[Later a Cisco employee wrote of selling non-hybrid cryptography to a significant customer, \"that's what they're willing to buy. Hence, Cisco will implement it\".] \n\nWhat do you do with your control over the U.S. military budget? That's another opportunity to \"shape the worldwide commercial cryptography marketplace\". You can tell people that you won't authorize purchasing double encryption. You can even follow through on having the military publicly purchase single encryption. Meanwhile you quietly spend a negligible amount of money on an independent encryption layer to protect the data that you care about, so you're actually using double encryption. \n\nThis seems to be a speculative scenario. But Bernstein is also concerned about how the Internet Engineering Task Force handled two drafts specifying post-quantum encryption mechanisms for TLS (\"the security layer inside HTTPS and inside various other protocols\"). For a draft suggesting \"non-hybrid\" encryption, there were 20 statements of support (plus 2 more only conditionally supporting it), but 7 more statements unequivocally opposing adoption, including one from Bernstein. The IETF has at times said they aim for \"rough consensus\" \u2014 or for \"broad consensus\" \u2014 but Bernstein insists 7 opposers in a field of 29 (24.13%) can't be said to match the legal definition of consensus (which is \"general agreement\"). \"I've filed a formal complaint regarding the claim of consensus to adopt.\" \nHe's also written a second blog post analyzing the IETF's decision-making process in detail. \"It's already bad that the IETF TLS working group adopted non-hybrid post-quantum encryption without official answers to the objections that were raised. It's much worse if the objections can't be raised in the first place.\" \nThanks to alanw (Slashdot reader #1,822) for spotting the blog posts.\n\n\nRead more of this story at Slashdot.",
