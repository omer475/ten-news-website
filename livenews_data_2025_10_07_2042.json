      "full_text": "UPDATED 15:22 EDT / OCTOBER 07 2025 by Brian Njuguna By turning artificial intelligence from theory into measurable business value, pragmatic enterprise AI adoption focuses on structured, results-driven integration rather than chasing flashy projects. Using a sensible enterprise AI adoption approach converts AI from buzzword to strategic driver of measurable business outcomes ‚Äî and Cohere Inc. is leading the way. This entails going the extra mile to deliver real return on investment, according to Autumn Moulder (pictured), vice president of engineering at Cohere. Cohere‚Äôs Autumn Moulder talks about enterprise AI adoption. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve really evolved and said, ‚ÄòWhat does an enterprise need to adopt this fundamentally transformational technology?‚Äô‚Äù Moulder asked. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve evolved from, we build the foundation model to let‚Äôs bring in some applications, the North products that we‚Äôve recently developed, to make it easier to adopt AI within the enterprise, to partnering with these companies to say, ‚ÄòHey, we can help you build a custom model. We can help you build a custom agent.‚Äô‚Äù Moulder spoke with theCUBE‚Äôs John Furrier at theCUBE + NYSE Wired: AI Factories ‚Äì Data Centers of the Future event, during an exclusive broadcast on theCUBE, SiliconANGLE Media‚Äôs livestreaming studio. They discussed the critical role of pragmatic enterprise AI adoption, noting innovations developed by Cohere. Partnerships are key to enterprise AI adoption. Scaling AI isn‚Äôt just about software ‚Äî it requires aligning technology, talent, data, processes and strategy. With deep expertise in machine learning, NLP, data engineering and AI governance, Cohere is already leading the way, according to Moulder. ‚ÄúWe very much have focused on that enterprise segment,‚Äù she explained. ‚ÄúWe see this as a place where we can drive a lot of value and really help people navigate this transition. There‚Äôs a recent MIT study that came out about how enterprise partnerships, where you partner with an external entity versus rolling it yourself, [has] like twice the success rate when you‚Äôre looking to adopt AI. We‚Äôve really taken that to heart coming from our foundations of building models.‚Äù Pragmatic enterprise AI adoption goes beyond installing software ‚Äî it demands the right blend of capabilities to tackle real business challenges. Large language models offer adaptability and conversational intelligence, while specialized models deliver precision and domain expertise. Together, they enable versatile, operationally effective AI solutions ‚Äî something Cohere is uniquely positioned to deliver, Moulder pointed out. ‚ÄúWe focus very much on efficiency, which ties it to this idea of large language models, small language models, what‚Äôs the right size model and making sure that we can deliver the point solution whether it‚Äôs a small language model for a highly efficient work flow,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe bring both of those to the table. We see this as an efficiency story and we also see it as a privacy story making sure you can hit both of those pieces.‚Äù Here‚Äôs the complete video interview, part of SiliconANGLE‚Äôs and theCUBE‚Äôs coverage of theCUBE + NYSE Wired: AI Factories ‚Äì Data Centers of the Future event: Support our mission to keep content open and free by engaging with theCUBE community.

      "full_text": "Jonah Hill is committing to his next movie role in a major way. The Wolf of Wall Street star looked unrecognizable in an eccentric costume highlighting his significant weight loss as he stepped out on set of his new comedy Cut Off in Los Angeles Oct. 6. While exiting his trailer, Jonah, 41, donned a skin-tight leopard print turtleneck, blue jeans with black fringe and tan boots. He completed the quirky ensemble by sporting shaggy blonde hair and a pair of cat-eye glasses. The film, which costars Kristen Wiig, follows two siblings whose wealthy parents cut them off financially, according to The Hollywood Reporter. And Jonah is doing more than just take on a major role in front of the camera, he‚Äôs also directing and producing the project from a script he cowrote, with a theatrical release set for July 2026. It‚Äôs not the first time Jonah has transformed his body for a role, either. He previously spoke about gaining weight for the crime comedy War Dogs, later calling one of his celebrity pals for tips on how to tone up after filming. ‚ÄúI called Channing Tatum and said, ‚ÄòHey, if I eat less and go to a trainer, will I get in good shape?‚Äô‚Äù he said during an appearance on The Tonight Show in 2016. ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs like, ‚ÄòYeah, you dumb motherf--ker, of course you will. It‚Äôs the simplest thing in the entire world.‚Äô‚Äù But the Oscar nominee has also been candid about struggling with his appearance. In 2021, he penned an open letter detailing his struggles with his weight after photos of him shirtless at the beach were published online. ‚ÄúI don't think I ever took my shirt off in a pool until I was in my mid 30s even in front of family and friends,‚Äù he wrote in a post on his Instagram page, which he deleted in August 2022. ‚ÄúProbably would have happened sooner if my childhood insecurities weren't exacerbated by years of public mockery about my body by press and interviewers.‚Äù But as Jonah went on to note, his self-worth had come a long way since then. ‚ÄúThe idea that the media tries to play me by stalking me while surfing and printing photos like this and it can't phase me anymore is dope,‚Äù he continued. ‚ÄúI'm 37 and finally love and accept myself.‚Äù Keep reading to see more stars who have undergone major weight loss transformations‚Ä¶ Trevor Larcom The Fresh Off the Boat alum used to weigh 300 pounds and lost 130, showcasing his journey on TikTok.

I wish I looked at food that way.‚Äù Weight was still ‚Äúthe mountain‚Äù in front of him, Jelly Roll noted, but his lifestyle changes were working. \"I'm learning, I'm being very diligent with it,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúI'm taking it serious, I'm drinking a bunch of water, I'm cold plunging, I'm eating right, I'm doing good.\" Al Roker Al Roker wasn‚Äôt kidding around with the title of his cookbook Recipes to Live By. Because having lost a hard-fought 100 pounds, the longtime TODAY weatherman literally walks the walk (aiming for at least 10,000 steps a day), watching what he eats and fitting in some sort of exercise on a daily basis. ‚ÄúMy mantra is ‚Äòsomething is better than nothing,‚Äô‚Äù he told People in a June 2025 interview. ‚ÄúMaybe you‚Äôll be running marathons or entering weight-lifting contests, but I think most people just want a level of fitness that improves their quality of life.‚Äù Roker underwent gastric bypass surgery in 2002 to get his fitness journey underway, but, he acknowledged, ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no magic bullet.‚Äù Surgery is ‚Äúnot the end,‚Äù he advised. ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre still going to have to put in the work.‚Äù Jason Kelce While previously known fo",

      "full_text": "In a reprise of their Olympic debut at Tokyo 2020, Ireland‚Äôs Rob Dickson and Se√°n Waddilove stole a solid race win to open their World Championship series in Sardinia on Tuesday. The Howth and Skerries pairing opted to duck behind the main line of boats starting the race after spotting a gap between the fleet and the committee boat. Hitting the line exactly on the signal and already at speed, the IRL99 crew ‚Äúport-tacked‚Äù away from the others in clear air as they headed for mark one with a clear lead. With the advantage of open water ahead, they extended their position over the two laps of the course and scored a memorable first place. However, that victory will be sorely needed as motivation over the coming five day. In the following two races, as the breeze first freshened and then started to fade, spotting the wind shifts against the intensity of the setting sun became challenging. Two deep results of 25th and 20th followed, leaving them with an uphill climb from which they will have to recover over the coming days. The worst race discard will likely see them drop the 25th-place finish, but this year‚Äôs event is trialling a new Olympic medal race format. As usual, the top third of the fleet will initially aim to qualify for the gold fleet. From there, the final race of the gold series will be umpired, meaning no rules protests will be held ashore afterwards which would delay results. The top four boats remaining after that race then qualify for the medal race final. In a major departure from standard competitions until now, the boat that wins the medal race is guaranteed gold. The previous first and second-placed boats would still be guaranteed a medal but would need the final win for the gold. The new format is a trial before a decision is taken by World Sailing on the matter at its annual congress, which will be held in D√∫n Laoghaire early next month. The proposed changes seek to satisfy the International Olympic Committee that the sport can deliver an exciting climax to competitions to address falling television audience numbers.",

The events included a cabinet meeting with sixteen cabinet members and senior White House officials, followed by a VIP vigil attended by dignitaries from the White House, ambassadors, and faith leaders, honoring the victims and hostages of October 7th. Secretary of State Marco Rubio stated: ‚ÄúYou have all inspired us. President Trump is committed to putting this tragedy to an end. Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner will head to the region shortly to help bring this matter to a close. I am confident and hopeful that the next time we gather here, it will be to remember that tragic day ‚Äî with all 48 hostages home.‚Äù Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick stated: ‚ÄúAlmost all Cabinet members gathered here today to support the urgent call of President Trump, survivors and hostages‚Äô families to release all the hostages now. We are in critical days and we trust Ambassador Wittkoff and the team in Egypt to finalize this agreement for a better future in the Middle East.‚Äù Captivity survivor Noa Argamani said: ‚ÄúI am especially grateful to President Trump for his support and commitment to the hostage deal since the day he was elected. I miss Avinatan more with every passing day. I hold onto hope, every single day, that this nightmare will end soon, and we‚Äôll finally get to live the life we‚Äôve dreamed of.‚Äù Captivity survivor Doron Steinbrecher said: ‚ÄúWhen the first deal collapsed, I was told I was going home. I believed it. For a moment, I felt hope. But then the sounds of war returned, and I knew it was over. The despair was crushing. After 471 days, I walked out of Gaza. But even now, I cannot truly move on. For us, there is no ‚Äòafter.‚Äô The trauma follows you. It lives in your body. And as long as others remain in Gaza, a part of me remains there too. I cannot fully begin to heal while they are still suffering.‚Äù Arbel Yehoud, captivity survivor and partner of Ariel Cunio, stated: ‚ÄúI will forever be grateful to President Trump for saving my life and getting me home to my family, to my loved ones. Only because of your courage and determination, Mr. President, I stand here today. And I dare to ask, please, bring back my Ariel, his brother David, and all the remaining hostages. They must come home. Now.‚Äù Lishay Miran-Lavi, survivor of the 10.7 attack and wife of Omri Miran, said: ‚ÄúI came because it‚Äôs not over until it‚Äôs over - until every one of them is released from Hamas‚Äôs tunnels. Until Omri and the 47 others are home. This deal ensures that every hostage will be released within the first 72 hours. Israel has already agreed. Hamas claims it has too. Now it is time to act. No more politics. No more excuses. No more delays.‚Äù Captivity survivor Keith Siegel said: ‚ÄúOn October 7th, 251 innocent people were kidnapped to Gaza. 42 were killed and murdered in captivity. In the past 2 years, through diplomacy and negotiations, 140 hostages have been brought back. I am here, standing in front of you today as a result of a life saving agreement. That agreement was secured through leaders who made it a priority.‚Äù Liran Berman, brother of Gali and Ziv Berman, said: ‚ÄúPresident Trump, please, don‚Äôt stop now. You‚Äôve brought us this far. Finish what you started, what we know and trust you can. Bring my brothers home. Bring all of the hostages home. Let this be the moment the world finally acts with courage and compassion.

      "full_text": "ByLindsey Darvin, Contributor. Disney and ESPN's strategic, long-term investment and representative leadership, championed by women executives, have driven unprecedented growth in women's sports. Record WNBA viewership and significant advertising revenue demonstrate this isn't a fleeting trend but a powerful movement. Their approach, treating women's sports as a core business, proves representative leadership yields strong cultural and financial results. The numbers tell a story that Rita Ferro, President of Global Advertising at Disney, has been building toward for years. The 2024 WNBA season delivered ESPN‚Äôs second most-watched coverage ever, up 170 percent year-over-year, with 54 million unique viewers and 22 games seeing over one million viewers tune in. The 2025 WNBA regular season built on this viewership success as ESPN networks recorded their most watched WNBA regular season, and a 6 percent increase from 2024 viewership numbers. The 2025 regular season games averaged 1.3 million viewers, including ESPN‚Äôs most-watched WNBA game on record when 2.7 million viewers tuned in on May 17 to watch the Chicago Sky at Indiana Fever on ABC. For Ferro and her ESPN executive counterparts, this growth was inevitable, not some huge payout from a risky bet. \"Women‚Äôs sports are one of the fastest-growing opportunities in all of sports, full stop,\" Ferro said. \"The trajectory is undeniable. We‚Äôre already seeing breakthrough moments with record ratings, sold-out arenas, and cultural relevance that rivals any other property.‚Äù Importantly, it‚Äôs becoming clear that this trajectory of women‚Äôs sport growth didn‚Äôt happen by accident. Instead, it‚Äôs the product of strategic decisions made by women leaders at both Disney and ESPN who saw opportunity when others saw uncertainty. These women leaders have been building up business cases for women‚Äôs sport while others continued to consider the industry to be a charity case. As noted by Ferro, ‚Äú‚Ä¶diversity of thought leads to better outcomes. The more perspectives you have at the table, the stronger the decisions. And for me personally, as a working mom, I feel a responsibility to set an example, not just for my daughter, but for all young women watching what‚Äôs possible.‚Äù These sentiments became even more apparent across my recent conversations with four key Disney and ESPN executives. In addition to Rita Ferro, three ESPN executives (Roz Durant with it the Executive Vice President, Programming & Acquisitions, Tina Thornton, who is the Executive Vice President, Creative Studio and Marketing, and Chara-Lynn Aguiar, who is the Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer), shared similar sentiments that intentional and representative leadership has been able to create what Durant described as unstoppable momentum, \"the sky is the limit and women's sports are on a rocket ship!\" These women leaders noted that ESPN has played a key role in the women‚Äôs sports boom through decades of strategic investment, innovative partnerships, and what Ferro described as ‚Äúconviction plus proof,‚Äù further noting that, ‚ÄúESPN was one of the first to invest heavily in women‚Äôs sports, giving it prime exposure and treating it with the same seriousness as men‚Äôs sports.‚Äù This leadership approach provides an important blueprint for other organizations, as both Disney and ESPN are showing that representative leadership drives both cultural change and business results, even within an industry that has historically been dominated by men and men's sports. As Ferro put it, ‚Äúrepresentation matters. If you can see it, you can be it. Visibility of women leaders both inspires the next generation and normalizes women in positions of influence. That‚Äôs one of the reasons ESPN has doubled down on women‚Äôs sports, because visibility creates momentum.‚Äù And this representative leadership approach has led to one of the best sport investments to date. While other media competitors are playing catchup in trying to cash in on the momentum across women‚Äôs sports, the women leaders I spoke with at both Disney and ESPN each made sure to explain that they have been here all along. \"Women‚Äôs Sports is part of ESPN‚Äôs DNA,\" said Tina Thornton, who has been with the company for more than 30 years. \"ESPN isn‚Äôt new to Women‚Äôs Sports. We‚Äôve been a partner of the NCAA Women‚Äôs Tournament since 1996.\" Chara-Lynn Aguiar reinforced these points from Thornton, sharing that \"this is not a new strategy for us, we have been investing in the space for many years and we have credibility.\" She noted that \"male and female executives alike all champion women's sports\" and points to recent examples including the \"WNBA, NCAA, NWSL, WLL, as well as our programming team optimizing our schedule.\" The difference in how ESPN has worked with women‚Äôs sports over the decades, especially once compared with the later-arriving competitors, have been the efforts to treat women's sports as more of a core business strategy rather than experimental or charity programming.",

The eight-part series, hosted by Jesse Burgess, food expert and co-founder of the global food and travel platform Topjaw, takes viewers inside the emotionally charged, high-stakes world of fine dining ‚Äî capturing the pressure and ambition that define the road to Michelin recognition. Marie-louise Gumuchian for Reuters: ‚Äé ‚Äú(It) is a sort of a real reflection on what goes on in these businesses: what‚Äôs at stake, what kind of jeopardy is up for grabs and then the emotions,‚Äù Ramsay told Reuters. ‚ÄúThis is (an)‚Ä¶unscripted, real version of life in the culinary world and the extent you go to for the badge of honour ‚Ä¶ Actors want Oscars, football players want F.A. Cup winners‚Äô medals, chefs want Michelin stars.‚Äù Episodes show host Jesse Burgess meeting chefs as they compose menus, primp up dishes and seek to impress that lone diner who may be a secret Michelin inspector. There is also input from the anonymous Michelin inspectors, voiced by actors. ‚ÄúWe ask them questions and they answer. In reality, it was all ‚Ä¶ very secretive so that none of the producers or nobody actually saw the real-life inspectors,‚Äù Burgess said. ‚ÄúThey just judge the food on the plate.‚Äù Ramsay received his first Michelin star when he was head chef at London restaurant Aubergine. His own Restaurant Gordon Ramsay has held three stars since 2001‚Ä¶ Asked if he still gets nervous when Michelin issues new editions of the guide, Ramsay said: ‚ÄúI do get nervous ‚Ä¶ no one likes losing ‚Ä¶ (going) down to even two stars is unique, but ‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs major headlines if you do. I‚Äôm often asked, ‚ÄòWhat would you do if you did lose a star?‚Äô Then, I‚Äôd fight and win it back.‚Äù ‚Äé MacDailyNews Note: Apple TV+ is available on the Apple TV app in over 100 countries and regions, on over 1 billion screens, including iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, Apple Vision Pro, Mac, popular smart TVs from Samsung, LG, Sony, VIZIO, TCL and others, Roku and Amazon Fire TV devices, Chromecast with Google TV, PlayStation and Xbox gaming consoles, and at tv.apple.com, for $9.99 per month with a seven-day free trial for new subscribers.

      "full_text": "Busy Philipps thinks we could all stand to be a little more honest in our workout classes. Admittedly, it doesn't take a ton of convincing to get Philipps to share her unfiltered thoughts ‚Äî but in agreeing to wear a hot mic during a Zumba class, she might've unlocked some of her most candid takes yet. \"My hips have not seen this much action in a while,\" she says mid-class in a video shared on Oct. 6. \"I look like I'm in a high school theater production.\" This venture into unfamiliar terrain is just one of the ways Philipps is stepping into her \"sexy mom era\" ‚Äî a phase of life all about feeling confident and exploring what brings you joy. Although she's previously experienced symptoms of star student syndrome ‚Äî trying to be the best in class or working to impress the fitness instructor ‚Äî these days, she works out with herself in mind. \"The more empowered you are in yourself and what's true to you, the sexier it is to other people,\" she says. \"That's the thing that people respond to with me. They respond to the fact that I'm a little bit DGAF.\" \"Are people going to judge me? What if I need more water than some? What if I pee?\" Unfamiliar workout classes can definitely be intimidating, but as long as she's being honest, this is some of the most fun Philipps has had in a fitness setting. \"I have been looking for a new cardio workout that I don't hate,\" she tells Popsugar. \"I think it's a very relatable experience, right? You're trying a new thing for the first time, you're going by yourself, you're like, 'Oh God, am I wearing the right stuff? Are people going to judge me? What if I need more water than some? What if I pee?'\" That said, the fitness world and \"sexy mom era\" can be difficult to embrace, especially when you're faced with the pressure to make it all look picture-perfect. Philipps's advice? \"You have to let go of other people's expectations and feeling beholden to other people's ideas of what you should be doing,\" she says. \"Get in touch with what you want to do.\" She's doing her part by going on trips, re-uniting with old friends, and yes, trying new workouts that feel fun, not frustrating. Amid busy schedules and relentless feedback from the world around us, Philipps knows it can be hard to get grounded . . . but it's worth doing anyway. \"It's really important for us, all of us, to get out of our heads and into our bodies, especially women,\" she says. \"If you can take an hour every day or three times a week to just reconnect with your body, that is gonna pull you into your sexy mom era, for sure.\" Chandler Plante (she/her) is a social producer and staff writer for the Health & Fitness team at Popsugar.

      "full_text": "David Buono/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images In the little over 100 years since its founding, the American Bar Association has transformed from an organization designed to promote best practices in the legal profession to one promoting partisan political positions that are immoral, illegal, and unethical. But despite its woke commitments, the ABA has remained the nation‚Äôs only nationally recognized law school accreditor. On top of that, many states specifically require that those who sit for their state‚Äôs bar exam must first have graduated from an ABA-accredited law school. The ABA long ago ceased to promote best practices for legal education‚Äîleading my colleague at The Heritage Foundation and me to call for federal and state actions to end the ABA‚Äôs accreditation monopoly. In April, President Donald Trump issued an executive order explicitly criticizing the ABA‚Äôs accrediting arm for its problematic DEI practices and ordering the Department of Education to ‚Äúhold accountable [consistent with applicable law], including through denial, monitoring, suspension, or termination of accreditation recognition, accreditors who fail to meet the applicable recognition criteria or otherwise violate Federal law.‚Äù Trump clarified that accreditors violate federal law by ‚Äúrequiring institutions seeking accreditation to engage in unlawful discrimination in accreditation-related activity under the guise of ‚Äòdiversity, equity, and inclusion‚Äô initiatives.‚Äù That‚Äôs after U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi had already notified the ABA it was likely breaking the law by pushing its DEI policies. Last week, Texas became the first state to adopt our main state-level recommendation, with its supreme court eliminating the requirement that an individual has to have graduated from an ABA-accredited law school to sit for the bar in that state. ‚ÄúThe Court is of the tentative opinion that the ABA should no longer have the final say on whether a law school‚Äôs graduates are eligible to sit for the Texas bar exam and become licensed to practice law in Texas,‚Äù the Texas Supreme Court wrote. Now, it falls to the Texas Supreme Court itself to decide whether a law school qualifies as an ‚Äúapproved law school‚Äù eligible to have its graduates sit for, and become members of, the Texas bar. The change won‚Äôt take effect until early in 2026‚Äîafter a period for public comment‚Äîbut this is undoubtedly a step in the right direction. Texas isn‚Äôt the only state considering such changes. Florida‚Äôs Supreme Court is considering a similar step, and other states will likely follow suit‚Äîas they should. After all, the ABA tried to bully George Mason University‚Äôs law school into discriminating against students based on race‚Äîeven going so far as to threaten the school‚Äôs accreditation unless it applied different admissions standards based on race. The ABA has pushed policies that likely violate the First Amendment by restricting what attorneys can‚Äîand cannot‚Äîsay. And it even‚Äîabsurdly‚Äîclaimed the Equal Rights Amendment had become the 28th Amendment to the United States Constitution. That position proved so radical, legally untenable, and dangerous that even President Joe Biden‚Äôs own archivist (the official responsible for formally recognizing new constitutional amendments) rejected it, as did the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. Thankfully, Texas has taken a first and important step toward eliminating the ABA‚Äôs undue and unwarranted influence on legal education and the legal community more broadly.

      "full_text": "PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE CATHERINE Connolly has criticised the Budget and said that the government has ‚Äúutterly failed to learn from the Covid pandemic and the declaration of a climate emergency‚Äù. She was speaking in the D√°il this evening in reaction to the Budget 2026 announcement in her role as an Independent TD. While she said the government has acknowledged ‚Äúthat the planet is burning‚Äù, she said there is no ‚Äúrecognition‚Äù of this in the Budget. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt expect any Budget to sort out those crises,‚Äù said Connolly, ‚Äúbut I do expect a Budget to be put in context of the existential threat posed by climate change.‚Äù She added that ‚Äúwe‚Äôre failing to recognise that we can‚Äôt continue with the same, unsustainable growth approach and do something about climate change‚Äù. She also said there were no provisions in relation to public health infrastructure so that ‚Äúwe would be prepared for the next pandemic‚Äù. Connolly also said she was ‚Äúworried‚Äù by a lack of a mention to homelessness. She also accused the government of ‚Äútwisting language‚Äù around housing. ‚ÄúIf you are in receipt of a HAP payment, you are not adequately housed in terms of social housing, and you‚Äôre twisting language on its head,‚Äù said Connolly. Connolly also said there was an ‚Äúutter failure to recognise that there‚Äôs an absolute crisis of a housing problem in the Gaeltacht‚Äù. She also said that the government had ‚Äúreneged on its solemn promise to do away with the means test for carers‚Äù. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know why we can go with economists telling us we have a growth economy when we‚Äôre not valuing the number of carers that are doing unpaid leave,‚Äù added Connolly. Advertisement She said the number of people providing regular unpaid care increased by over 50% between 2016 and 2022 to reach close to 300,000. Last week, Social Protection Minister Dara Calleary said that while the Government ‚Äúremains committed to phasing out the carer‚Äôs allowance means test‚Äù, it cannot be done ‚Äùin a single budget‚Äù and that it will be done in a ‚Äúprogressive manner‚Äù. Connolly also remarked that the government has ‚Äúfailed to train enough people to work in our hospitals‚Äù and that these are problems that ‚Äúcome up year after year‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe need to actually put out the message that they‚Äôre not inevitable,‚Äù said Connolly. Meanwhile, Connolly remarked that the ‚Ç¨11 million increase for schemes targeting violence against women is a ‚Äúdrop in the ocean‚Äù. ‚ÄúDespite our third strategy for zero violence against women, the figures keep rising, it‚Äôs an absolute crisis.‚Äù She also warned that many people are ‚Äúpaying two mortgages, one for a house and one for childcare‚Äù. She said the ‚Äúabsolute answer is public childcare because otherwise people can‚Äôt work‚Äù. Connolly is running for the √Åras against Fine Gael pick Heather Humphreys and speaking to LMFM this morning, Humphreys was asked about the government‚Äôs record on housing. She said there is a ‚Äúdisaster‚Äù in housing and that ‚Äúbillions and billions has been spent on housing and what we need to see are results‚Äù. Humphreys said that as president, she would not ‚Äúlet the country down‚Äù. She was also asked if she would ‚Äúspeak out against government policy‚Äù and replied that while the presidency is ‚Äúabove politics‚Äù, she ‚Äúcan speak out and there‚Äôs nobody better to speak out for people‚Äù. ‚ÄúAs I said, the presidency is above politics and I can assure you that if I see wrongdoings, if I see injustices, I will speak out. ‚ÄúI have never been afraid to speak out for people, and as president, that‚Äôs what I will do, I will be a voice for this nation.‚Äù Readers like you are keeping these stories free for everyone...

      "full_text": "By Alejandro Lopez Vega October 07, 2025 Just over eight months remain until the FIFA World Cup 2026 kicks off in the United States, Mexico, and Canada. Argentina will arrive looking to defend the title they won in Qatar 2022, and having Lionel Messi and the rest of the squad‚Äôs stars available will be crucial. However, one important player won‚Äôt be on the field for the opening match of the tournament. On Tuesday, FIFA published a list of players still serving suspensions from the September international break, and Nicolas Otamendi was among them. The Benfica defender was sent off during the World Cup qualifier against Ecuador and received a one-match suspension, along with a fine of 5,000 Swiss francs (around $6,300). With South America‚Äôs World Cup qualifiers having ended last month, Otamendi no longer has the opportunity to serve the suspension during that competition. Under these circumstances, the Argentine defender will have to wait for the next official FIFA tournament to serve the ban. Argentina‚Äôs calendar includes four friendlies between October and November, which will wrap up their 2025 schedule. In March, they have one more friendly and, very likely, the Finalissima against Spain. That match, although official, won‚Äôt count toward fulfilling the suspension, as it is not a FIFA-organized tournament but rather co-hosted by UEFA and CONMEBOL. Nicolas Otamendi of Argentina. All of this leads to a tough consequence for Argentina: Otamendi will have no choice but to serve his one-match ban in the opening game of the FIFA World Cup 2026 group stage. That‚Äôs in line with Article 9.2 of the FIFA regulations: ‚ÄúPending match suspensions imposed as a result of a direct or an indirect red card in matches in the preliminary competition of the FIFA World Cup 2026 will be carried over to the final competition.‚Äù see also Bad news for Lionel Messi: Argentina star misses US October tour due to injury Nicolas Otamendi‚Äôs situation also applies to another South American star. Chelsea‚Äôs Moises Caicedo was also sent off in the same match between Ecuador and Argentina and will therefore miss his team‚Äôs opening game at the 2026 World Cup ‚Äî a significant blow for Ecuador, considering the midfielder‚Äôs importance. Although rare, cases like these have occurred in previous tournaments. At the FIFA World Cup 2014 in Brazil, several players missed their teams‚Äô openers due to suspensions carried over from earlier matches that hadn‚Äôt yet been served. Freddy Guarin missed Colombia‚Äôs opener in that tournament against Greece, a game the South Americans won 3‚Äì0. The same happened with Mario Mandzukic, who was unavailable for Croatia‚Äôs World Cup opener against Brazil, a match they lost 3‚Äì1. Like Messi, Nicolas Otamendi announced back in September that he will not take part in the next World Cup cycle. That made the match against Ecuador his final appearance in South American qualifiers. Naturally, that also means the 2026 tournament in the United States, Mexico, and Canada will be the defender‚Äôs last major competition at international level. see also Argentina National Team TV Schedule Otamendi will close out a successful run with Argentina that began in 2009 and included three World Cup appearances (South Africa 2010, Russia 2018, and Qatar 2022). Over the last 16 years, the defender has collected four titles: the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the 2021 and 2024 Copa America tournaments, and the 2022 Finalissima.",

      "full_text": "Honest, paywall-free news is rare. Please support our boldly independent journalism with a donation of any size. Six former U.S. surgeons general have published an op-ed in The Washington Post, warning Americans that Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is using his role as head of the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to endanger the health of the nation. The authors of the op-ed, which was published on Monday, represent ‚Äúformer U.S. surgeons general appointed by every Republican and Democratic president since George H.W. Bush‚Äù ‚Äî including Jerome Adams, Richard Carmona, Joycelyn Elders, Vivek Murthy, Antonia Novello and David Satcher. The surgeons general said that they‚Äôve taken ‚Äútwo sacred oaths‚Äù in their lifetimes ‚Äî one as physicians and another as public servants. ‚ÄúIn keeping with those oaths, we are compelled to speak with one voice to say that the actions of Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. are endangering the health of the nation,‚Äù they wrote. Never miss the news and analysis you care about. ‚ÄúDespite differences in perspectives, we have always been united in an unwavering commitment to science and evidence-based public health. It is that shared principle that led us to this moment,‚Äù the authors went on, adding that Kennedy is a ‚Äúdriving force‚Äù behind a ‚Äúcrisis‚Äù of the department lacking scientific integrity and transparency. The former surgeons general said that Kennedy was unable to ‚Äúrestore trust‚Äù among the public when it comes to vital health initiatives, citing Kennedy‚Äôs long history of spreading lies about vaccines and his ‚Äúde-emphasis‚Äù of vaccination in the face of the worst measles outbreak in the U.S. over the past three decades. They also cited Kennedy‚Äôs recent (and discredited) claim that use of acetaminophen during pregnancy is linked to autism. That claim ‚Äúhas been widely condemned by the scientific and medical communities, who have pointed out that the available research is inconclusive and insufficient to justify such a warning,‚Äù they wrote. Rather than combating the rapid spread of health misinformation with facts and clarity, Kennedy is amplifying it. The consequences aren‚Äôt abstract. They are measured in lives lost, disease outbreaks and an erosion of public trust that will take years to rebuild. ‚ÄúSecretary Kennedy is entitled to his views. But he is not entitled to put people‚Äôs health at risk,‚Äù the former surgeons general wrote. ‚ÄúHe has rejected science, misled the public and compromised the health of Americans. The nation deserves a health and human services secretary who is committed to scientific integrity and can restore morale and trust in our public health agencies.‚Äù Kennedy has been widely condemned for his actions as head of HHS. Last month, 16 states plus Washington, D.C. sued HHS due to its threats to cut funding for sex ed classes if they included lessons on transgender people. HHS announced in August that it would no longer fund what it called ‚Äúgender ideology,‚Äù baselessly claiming that lessons that acknowledge the existence of trans people would ‚Äúpoison the minds of the next generation.‚Äù Other examples of Kennedy‚Äôs incompetence abound. In May, for example, HHS, under his leadership, released a ‚ÄúMake America Healthy Again‚Äù report that included multiple errant and fraudulent citations. A deeper examination of that report revealed that it was created in large part by using Artificial Intelligence (AI), a move that experts blasted as widely irresponsible due to the technology‚Äôs tendency to completely make up ‚Äúfacts.‚Äù And this past summer, Kennedy dismissed the entirety of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP), a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) board that issues guidance on vaccines and other methods to prevent infection. Kennedy filled most of the vacant spots on that board with anti-vaxxers and conspiracy theorists. According to a Quinnipiac University poll published in September, only 33 percent of Americans approve of the job Kennedy has done so far, while 54 percent disapprove. In the same survey, respondents were asked how confident they were in Kennedy‚Äôs medical advice. Only 39 percent said they had confidence in the information Kennedy cited, while 57 percent said they didn‚Äôt have much confidence in him.

Generation Zers have devised a new way to mentally detox from omnipresent digital distractions ‚Äî by undertaking challenges where they do nothing all day, as seen in TikTok clips with thousands of views. Dubbed rawdogging, the practice involves staring into space sans entertainment, sleep or other distractions to give themselves a respite in an age where everyone is glued to their screen. The craze initially took off this past summer aboard flights ‚Äî with Gen Z ascetics filming themselves undertaking sky-high psychological fasts ‚Äî but has since fanned out to other areas. In a recent series of videos, a self-proclaimed ‚Äúproductivity‚Äù influencer named Rowan conducted an experiment where he rawdogged for an hour each day to fix his ‚Äúattention span.‚Äù He explained that he‚Äôd been struggling with a ‚Äúshort attention span‚Äù due to ‚Äúconstant dopamine hits from my phone, caffeine, sugary foods and games.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis gave me such hard time to focus on my work and the things I really care about,‚Äù he explained, adding that he felt he needed to have his brain ‚Äúwander off freely without any stimulation.‚Äù It‚Äôs safe to say it was a lot of work for ‚Äúnothing.‚Äù In the first of the daily clips ‚Äî a 30-second timelapse filmed on Sept. 29, 2025 ‚Äî the content creator is seen sitting in a recliner fidgeting with his eyes closed at 120x speed. ‚ÄúJust sitting there doing nothing was a lot harder than I thought,‚Äù Rowan wrote. By day 7, the ascetic Jedi had mastered the art of ‚Äúbore,‚Äù explaining that he found boredom a lot more ‚Äúcomfortable.‚Äù He explained that he used to use his phone everywhere, including during showering, eating and on the toilet, but had recently not felt the need to ‚Äúcarry it everywhere.‚Äù The rawdogging marathon also paid major dividends on his output as well. ‚ÄúBecause I don‚Äôt need constant stimulation, I feel a lot more productive,‚Äù said Rowan. ‚ÄúI focus on the things that actually matter to me, like my work, relationships and being more present in the moment that matters instead of checking my phone every two seconds.‚Äù He added, ‚ÄúSo far I‚Äôm satisfied with the results.‚Äù Many viewers lauded Rowan‚Äôs rawdogging Odyssey with one fan calling the challenge ‚Äúgenuinely helpful‚Äù while another wrote, ‚Äúmotivating.‚Äù ‚ÄúI couldn‚Äôt even make it through watching you do this for 1 minute,‚Äù lamented one. However, others were less impressed. Recently, I have been struggling with having short attention span. Constant dopamine hits from my phone, caffeine, sugary foods and games. This gave me such hard time to focus on my work and the things I really care about. Then I came across a challenge for fixing your attention span. The premise for this challenge is for your brain to take a break and wander off freely without any stimulation. This is my first day of this challenge. I never tried this and it was challenging. Just sitting there doing nothing was a lot harder than I thought. I‚Äôm going to be doing this challenge for 30 days to show the difference. #dopaminedetox #100dayschallenge #focus #productivity #habitstacking ‚ÄúAnything but doing something productive,‚Äù said one detractor. Others accused Rowan of simply rebranding ‚Äúmeditation,‚Äù echoing criticism of Zoomers discovering things that already exist such as ‚Äúgirl dinners‚Äù (AKA leftovers). Coincidentally, many experts have espoused the virtues of being disinterested. ‚ÄúLearning how to tolerate boredom is an important skill,‚Äù Stacey Rosenfeld, PhD, a Rockland County psychologist, previously told the Post while speaking on the perks of being bored as a child. ‚ÄúThere are always going to be times when we‚Äôre bored. If we never allow ourselves to have that feeling of wondering ‚ÄòWhat should I do with this time,‚Äô how will we do that as adults?‚Äù In fact, some experts not only endorse boredom, they prescribe it. ‚ÄúDr. Carl Marci, a psychiatrist and author, claims that, after being bored for a while, his children will ‚Äústart to creatively solve their problems or distract themselves with social interaction or play,‚Äù allowing them to be curious and imaginative. Constant access to personal devices and screens ‚Äî which feature ‚Äúcontent designed primarily to capture a child‚Äôs attention and engage them as long as possible‚Äù ‚Äî teaches kids that ‚Äúthey don‚Äôt have to ever be bored,‚Äù he added. This isn‚Äôt just anecdotal, either. A study out of Texas A&M University found that boredom serves as a psychological signal to seek new experiences and grow as people.",

      "full_text": "EXCLUSIVE: Filmmaker Per Prinz has rounded out the cast of Coyote, a border thriller on which we were first to report, with four additions: Cheech Marin (Up in Smoke), Teresa Ruiz (Narcos: Mexico), Dean Norris (Breaking Bad), and newcomer Katie Tripp. Described as a gritty, modern-day thriller exploring the dangerous underworld of border smuggling, the film‚Äôs lead is Esai Morales. Others in key roles include Mel Gibson and Renata Notni. The story follows Hern√°n Barroca (Morales), a weathered ex-smuggler pulled back into the dangerous world he thought he had left behind. When Hern√°n helps Julia and her young daughter, Maribel, navigate treacherous borderlands, their desperate journey triggers the wrath of a ruthless trafficking syndicate. As past and present collide ‚Äî with U.S. Border Patrol agent Jack Bradley (Gibson) joining the pursuit ‚Äî Hern√°n must rely on his cunning and grit to survive and find redemption. Marin plays Javier, a beacon of strength and light in a city controlled by the cartel, with Ruiz as Gabriella, a wise and resilient woman from Nogales who looks after those in need. Norris portrays the cunning and relentless Chief Dennison, with Tripp as Liz Bradley, a border patrol agent with a true-north moral compass, in her first major film role. Watch on Deadline Prinz wrote the script with Adam J. Goldstein. Scott Smith is producing for Fire Tiger Studios, along with Hamid and Camille Torabpour of Winter State Entertainment, and Morales and his Richport Entertainment. Breaking out in the ‚Äô70s as one half of the famed comedy duo Cheech & Chong, Marin has nearly 200 film and television credits, though he‚Äôs perhaps best known for roles in Tin Cup, Born in East L.A. and Up in Smoke, as well as the CBS police procedural Nash Bridges. Ruiz first garnered attention for her work in Netflix‚Äôs Narcos: Mexico before going on to projects like the Netflix series Mo and the film Father Stu opposite Mark Wahlberg. Best known for his role as DEA agent Hank Schrader on Breaking Bad, Norris can currently be seen starring alongside Christopher Meloni on Law & Order: Organized Crime. Other credits include Little Miss Sunshine, Carry On and TNT‚Äôs Claws, to name just a few. Norris is repped by Innovative Artists ‚Äî as are Marin and Ruiz. Marin is also repped by Weintraub Tobin Chediak; Ruiz by Hirsch Wallerstein Hayum; and Norris by Constellation Media Group. Tripp is repped by Marv Dauer Management and Abstract Talent Agency.

      "full_text": "Maria Steen has called for the 2025 Irish presidential election to be cancelled and run again, claiming its political legitimacy has been ‚Äúfurther undermined‚Äù by Fianna F√°il candidate Jim Gavin ending his campaign. Ms Steen, a conservative campaigner who had tried to run as an independent candidate, missed out on a place on the ballot paper after securing 18 of the required 20 signatures from TDs and senators before the deadline for nominations. Some of her supporters, who include social conservatives and other right-wing voters, have threatened to spoil their ballots on October 24th in protest at what they see as a lack of choice. Ms Steen‚Äôs failure to get enough support to run as a candidate also prompted criticism and online abuse of Independent TDs and Senators who declined to back her. Ms Steen says the dramatic exit of Mr Gavin from the race has ‚Äúfurther undermined‚Äù the upcoming poll. ‚ÄúDemocracy is supposed to mean that the people get to decide. The political legitimacy of the presidential election was already in doubt due to the closing of ranks by the major parties, which prevented any independent candidate from making it as far as the ballot,‚Äù Ms Steen said. ‚ÄúIt has now been further undermined by the dramatic implosion of the Fianna F√°il-backed candidacy of Jim Gavin. As a result, the public is left with very little choice, and a large constituency feels totally unrepresented. ‚ÄúGiven all that has happened, the better course at this stage would be to cancel the election and call a new one, if for no other reason than to secure public acceptance of the legitimacy of whoever is ultimately elected to serve as our next president.‚Äù Ms Steen said that if the presidential election was run again, it is ‚Äúlikely‚Äù that she would try to run again. [ A timeline of Jim Gavin‚Äôs short-lived push for the presidencyOpens in new window ] This month‚Äôs poll will now be the first presidential election in more than 50 years to only have two candidates actively contesting, though Mr Gavin will remain on the ballot paper. Canvassing in Louth on Tuesday, Fine Gael candidate Heather Humphreys said she was the ‚Äúcentre ground, common sense, pro-European candidate in this election‚Äù. ‚ÄúThe presidency is above party politics and I am asking voters to place their trust in me so that I can bring my experience to the role of president,‚Äù Ms Humphreys said.

      "full_text": "Sign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily. After several years of emphasizing comfort, Victoria‚Äôs Secret is pivoting back to sexy. CEO Hillary Super, who took over last September, said in a recent interview with the Wall Street Journal that the underwear company had made a mistake by pulling back from the showy lingerie and suggestive advertising on which it made its name. Under Super‚Äôs direction, the brand has rolled out new additions to its ‚ÄúVery Sexy‚Äù collection, which features harness-inspired underwear, bejeweled ‚Äúmaximum lift‚Äù push-up bras that promise an increase of two cup sizes, and a thong with a tassel that dangles down one‚Äôs crack. The company is still presenting plenty of new comfort-driven basics and athleticwear, but it‚Äôs also adding lace teddies, costumes fit for a Halloween sex party, bras that quit before they reach the nipple, and a crotchless, cup-less leotard. (I use that term lightly.) On social media, the brand is pushing sheer lingerie, aggressive push-up bras, flouncy floral designs, and undergarments with blingy straps emblazoned with the company name. Victoria‚Äôs Secret is also leaning back into the glitzy flamboyance of its annual lingerie fashion show, which returned last year for the first time since 2018. I hate to be the person who always brings up Donald Trump in conversations about thongs, but it‚Äôs no coincidence that the end of Victoria‚Äôs Secret‚Äôs brief period of soft-touch sexuality has come at this precise moment. The past few years in fashion have heralded a return to both traditional femininity (ruffles, ballet flats) and shameless sexiness (clothing with cutouts), a two-pronged trend that has only accelerated during Trump 2.0. A partial referendum on the feminist triumphs and atmosphere of sexual caution of the #MeToo era, the new mode is also visible in the so-called Mar-a-Lago face adopted by women in the MAGA extended universe, which wears its garish makeup and medi-spa modifications as points of pride. Taut and filler-plumped, the Mar-a-Lago face somewhat resembles a push-up bra itself. Trump is concocting a world that rewards unabashedly manufactured caricatures of femininity. Who better to capitalize on the moment than a company that has, for generations, made the straight-faced argument that the sexiest thing in the world is a stiff, sculpted undergarment that hides our softest body parts behind a forbidding wall of foam? The original decision to dilute the raciness of the Victoria‚Äôs Secret brand, made by former head Martin Waters, came in 2019, when market research showed that its customers were looking for easy-wearing undergarments at low price points. Amid renewed scrutiny on Jeffrey Epstein‚Äîa close associate of former Victoria‚Äôs Secret CEO Les Wexner‚Äîand a 2020 New York Times expos√© on the sexism and sexual harassment suffered by employees and models, the company was battling a reputation for being ‚Äúinappropriate and off-color,‚Äù Waters told the Journal. In came a spate of products that seemed more fit for relaxation or exercise than brazen, sexually charged trysts, dovetailing with the rise of athleisure and the surge in demand for bralettes that came with the pandemic. Ad campaigns brought in models of varying body types and focused on the garments‚Äô comfort and value. The shift was an initial success, but eventually flopped. When Super took over from Waters last year, Victoria‚Äôs Secret was struggling, with sales on the downswing for more than two years. Having lost its hold on the mid-market American underwear drawer in a more crowded marketplace, it was ill-positioned to compete with new retailers like Kim Kardashian‚Äôs Skims, which sells sleek, neutral-toned basics, and other brands that offered a range of larger sizes. Both Super and Adam Selman, the executive creative director she tapped in the spring, have held top spots at Savage X Fenty, Rihanna‚Äôs affordable, size-inclusive lingerie brand. The new CEO says she is banking on a new interpretation of sexiness, one that appreciates a certain degree of comfort‚Äîa new bra boasts a more flexible underwire‚Äîand keeps the current body-positive outlook that was scorned by leaders of Wexner‚Äôs era. At the same time, she has tried to revive the hyperfeminine, male-gaze-oriented fantasy sold by Victoria‚Äôs Secret for decades before Waters restrained it. So far, it seems to be working: The company‚Äôs stock has risen almost 8 percent since Super took over, and in the most recent quarter, sales were up 3 percent over the same period last year, beating analysts‚Äô estimates. To the untrained eye, Victoria‚Äôs Secret‚Äôs new offerings don‚Äôt look much different from the old ones. In fact, the shift might be too subtle for casual consumers to clock on their own‚Äîmore about the brand‚Äôs photo-shoot vibes and product merchandising than any dramatic about-face in design. Perhaps customers will be wooed by the fantasy of looking like a seductive model wear",

      "full_text": "RIGHTS GROUPS AND childcare organisations have slammed the budget allocation for early learning and childcare today, as opposition politicians have called out the Government for failing to live up to its election-time promises on capping childcare costs. Minister for Children Norma Foley said that the Government is making an ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù investment in disability services and in children. The headline figures sound good: ‚Ç¨3.8 billion has been secured for the delivery of disability services alongside the HSE, which we are also told is ‚Äúunprecedented‚Äù, and ‚Ç¨1.48 billion for early learning and childcare, which the Department of Children says will ‚Äúreduce costs for families and increase supports for staff and providers‚Äù. However, there was no mention from the Minister or her colleagues today of the promise that both government parties made during the 2024 election that childcare costs would be capped at ‚Ç¨200 per month for parents across the country. While there is no specific package on childcare costs in the budget, funding increased by 9%, which equates to an increase of ‚Ç¨125 million. Foley today outlined that this funding increase will allow for over 286,000 children to benefit from the National Childcare Scheme, and for over 105,000 children to benefit from the Early Childhood Care programme. She also said that this will allow for 2,300 additional childcare places through the Government‚Äôs Core Funding Scheme. However, as Foley was outlining these measures, statements were coming in from organisations that represent childcare providers and rights‚Äô groups that universally said that this budget was a missed opportunity to tackle systemic childcare issues, barriers to access, and spiralling waitlists. The National Women‚Äôs Council (NWC) pointed out that the planned increase in places for the rest of this year and 2026 will do little to address the list of over 50,000 children waiting on a place. Doireann Crosson, Head of Policy for the NWC said that she welcomes the overall focus on childcare in this budget, but added that it‚Äôs ‚Äúdisappointing‚Äù that the places promised will be offered through existing schemes ‚Äúwhich continue to rely on private and often for-profit providers‚Äù. Early Childhood Ireland, another representative organisation for providers, said that ‚Äúthis approach will not address the systemic issues in our childcare system,‚Äù and that the additional places will ‚Äúbarely make a dent‚Äù. It was widely reported that Foley was pushing for a childcare costs package in this budget ‚Äì and while her department has an overall funding increase, it falls short of putting money back in parents‚Äô pockets or taking any major action to address the shortage of childcare places across the country. When asked by The Journal if she is disappointed that those kinds of measures aren‚Äôt provided for, and if she thinks voters who were swayed by the promise of childcare at ‚Ç¨200 a month, Foley insisted that childcare costs will be brought down ‚Äúover the lifetime of the Government‚Äù. Minister for Children Norma Foley acknowledges that childcare costs are still too high for many parents, and says that this budget will see a maximum fee cap in place for next Sept. No mention of the election promise of capping childcare costs at ‚Ç¨200 per month. @thejournal_ie pic.twitter.com/YtsgLgK274‚Äî Eimer McAuley (@eimer_mcauley) October 7, 2025 Minister for Children Norma Foley acknowledges that childcare costs are still too high for many parents, and says that this budget will see a maximum fee cap in place for next Sept. No mention of the election promise of capping childcare costs at ‚Ç¨200 per month. @thejournal_ie pic.twitter.com/YtsgLgK274 Advertisement In what is generally being perceived as the most austere budget in years, it seems that Foley is amongst several Ministers who had to settle for less than they would have hoped for. Foley was pressed for a response to the reaction from various groups today. In response to the comments made by the NWC, she said: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve always been very clear that there are three elements to ensuring that we are accessible in this sphere, one is that we would have accessibility, two, that we reduce the costs for parents, and three, that we have staff in place who are fully trained and happy to work in the sector. ‚ÄúLooking forward to 2026, this is the first budget of five that will begin supporting each of those three elements, to deliver better opportunity for children, and also parents,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve been very clear that this is a commitment of our Government over the next five years‚Ä¶ we know that there are 73,000 places that are unused because we don‚Äôt have the staff,‚Äù she said. Foley pointed to the measures she has secured in this budget to get workers and providers onside with Government schemes. These include the continued rollout of the Core Funding Scheme. ‚ÄúCore Funding will also support improved pay for educators and school-age childcare practitioners with the implementation of the 2025 Employment Regu",

      "full_text": "Attorney General Pam Bondi faced a contentious hearing on Tuesday, fielding sharp questions from senators regarding the Justice Department's handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files. The high-stakes testimony, covered live by outlets like the BBC, placed her at the centre of intense political scrutiny amid a deeply polarised environment. The session was closely watched by political analysts and the public. Nevertheless, as the serious proceedings unfolded, a far different conversation gained traction online. Public curiosity shifted from policy toward her personal life, with the question 'Is Pam Bondi married?' providing a peculiar backdrop to the day's events. Inside the hearing room, senators from both parties engaged in rigorous questioning. The discussions centred on the Justice Department's handling of the recently released Jeffrey Epstein files, a topic that has generated significant public interest. Lawmakers demanded greater transparency on why certain names were redacted, pushing Ms Bondi on the department's process. According to Newsweek, the exchanges between Bondi and committee members were often sharp and confrontational, reflecting a broader public demand for accountability. Furthermore, lawmakers pressed Ms Bondi on her past statements regarding former FBI Director James Comey, which some critics have described as contradictory to her current positions. Axios reported that this line of questioning aimed to scrutinise the consistency of her leadership at the department. The hearing underscored the deep divisions and politically sensitive nature of the topics at hand. Throughout the hours-long testimony, Ms Bondi defended her department's actions with prepared and firm responses, arguing that all protocols were followed correctly. AG Pam Bondi: \"No one is above the law, that‚Äôs a quote from you, Senator Blumenthal.\" pic.twitter.com/WtTWAp30gX Despite the gravity of the proceedings, recent search interest in Ms Bondi's marital status began climbing shortly after the hearing commenced. The query 'Is Pam Bondi married?' quickly became a top trending topic related to her name. This phenomenon, often amplified by social media algorithms, highlights a common pattern where the personal lives of public figures become a focal point during moments of intense professional pressure. Such trends can sometimes overshadow the substantive policy debates at hand. This shift in focus reveals a disconnect between the critical issues debated in Washington and the topics that capture the public's immediate attention. While officials debated matters of national importance, many people were more interested in the attorney general's biography. For the record, public records indicate Pam Bondi has been married and divorced twice and is currently unmarried. This information, however, remained secondary to the significant policy implications of her testimony. The hearing concluded late in the afternoon, leaving questions about the long-term political fallout and her department's future decisions lingering in the capital.

This year, the U.S. government shutdown has grounded those navy flyers along with a host of other military craft.

The Snowbirds, red-and-white Tutor trainer jets familiar to Canadians from their appearances at Toronto‚Äôs CNE airshow and other events across the country, will have pride of place in the Fleet Week show this coming weekend. Fleet Week has taken place annually over the Columbus Day Weekend since 1981. The only year that saw the event cancelled was 2013, when a 16-day U.S. government shutdown overlapped with the event. This time, organizers decided to keep going with a reduced set of performances and fly-bys. (The Blue Angels told the San Francisco Chronicle that their appearance is ‚Äúpaused‚Äù rather than ‚Äúcancelled,‚Äù in the hopes that the government may be up and running again by Friday.) This will be the second time in a month that the Royal Canadian Air Force has saved America‚Äôs bacon. Last weekend‚Äôs Pacific Airshow in Huntington Beach, Calif., had to go on minus the U.S. Air Force Thunderbirds teams thanks to the shutdown. But the nine-strong Snowbirds team stepped up as the headliners of the show, alongside some Royal Air Force planes and parachutists from the U.K., and a number of non-military teams and pilots not affected by the shutdown. ‚ÄúThank God Canada is not the 51st state yet,‚Äù Kevin Elliott, director of the show, told the New York Times, presumably in jest. He added that the organizers had been scrambling to rearrange the lineup around the sudden no-shows, but was relieved that the Snowbirds could ‚Äúshow up and, in a sense, save the day.‚Äù The Blue Angels are scheduled to appear in at least three more airshows over the next month: one in Georgia on the weekend of Oct. 17; and two in Florida on Oct. 25-26 and Nov. 1-2. There are no plans for the Snowbirds to fly in any of those shows. National Post has contacted the team for comment. The U.S. government shut down on Oct. 1. The longest shutdown in the nation‚Äôs history is 35 days, and began in 2018 during Donald Trump‚Äôs first presidency.

Ibrahima Konate's contract will expire at the end of the season as things stand. The Frenchman has been in some sort of talks with Liverpool for around a year now - but we're still to see anything signed. There's no question that Liverpool do want to keep Konate. The centre-back situation is messy right now and the 26-year-old is unquestionably the best person to add some solidity. He's coming into his prime, completely capable of playing at the elite level and required absolutely no bedding in. What more could Liverpool need?

The Conversation UK receives funding from these organisations View the full list https://doi.org/10.64628/AA.usav94mnn The electrification boom of the 1920s set the United States up for a century of industrial dominance and powered a global economic revolution. But before electricity faded from a red-hot tech sector into invisible infrastructure, the world went through profound social change, a speculative bubble, a stock market crash, mass unemployment and a decade of global turmoil. Understanding this history matters now. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a similar general purpose technology and looks set to reshape every aspect of the economy. But it‚Äôs already showing some of the hallmarks of electricity‚Äôs rise, peak and bust in the decade known as the Roaring Twenties. The reckoning that followed could be about to repeat. A century ago, when people at the New York Stock Exchange talked about the latest ‚Äúhigh tech‚Äù investments, they were talking about electricity. Investors poured money into suppliers such as Electric Bond & Share and Commonwealth Edison, as well as companies using electricity in new ways, such as General Electric (for appliances), AT&T (telecommunications) and RCA (radio). It wasn‚Äôt a hard sell. Electricity brought modern movies, new magazines from faster printing presses, and evenings by the radio. It was also an obvious economic game changer, promising automation, higher productivity, and a future full of leisure and consumption. In 1920, even Soviet revolutionary leader Vladimir Lenin declared: ‚ÄúCommunism is Soviet power plus the electrification of the whole country.‚Äù Today, a similar global urgency grips both communist and capitalist countries about AI, not least because of military applications. Like AI stocks now, electricity stocks ‚Äúbecame favorites in the boom even though their fundamentals were difficult to assess‚Äù. Market power was concentrated. Big players used complex holding structures to dodge rules and sell shares in basically the same companies to the public under different names. US finance professor Harold Bierman, who argued that attempts to regulate overpriced utility stocks were a direct trigger for the crash, estimated that utilities made up 18% of the New York Stock Exchange in September 1929. Within electricity supply, 80% of the market was owned by just a handful of holding firms. But that‚Äôs just the utilities. As today with AI, there was a much larger ecosystem. Almost every 1920s ‚Äúmegacap‚Äù (the largest companies at the time) owed something to electrification. General Motors, for example, had overtaken Ford using new electric production techniques. Essentially, electricity became the backdrop to the market in the same way AI is doing, as businesses work to become ‚ÄúAI-enabled‚Äù. No wonder that today tech giants command over a third of the S&P 500 index and nearly three-quarters of the NASDAQ. Transformative technology drives not only economic growth, but also extreme market concentration. In 1929, to reflect the new sector‚Äôs importance, Dow Jones launched the last of its three great stock averages: the electricity-heavy Dow Jones Utilities Average. The Dow Jones Utilities Average went as high as 144 in 1929. But by 1934, it had collapsed to just 17. No single cause explains the New York Stock Exchange‚Äôs unprecedented ‚ÄúGreat Crash‚Äù, which began on October 24 1929 and preceded the worldwide Great Depression. That crash triggered a banking crisis, credit collapse, business failures, and a drastic fall in production. Unemployment soared from just 3% to 25% of US workers by 1933 and stayed in double figures until the US entered the second world war in 1941. The ripple effects were global, with most countries seeing a rise in unemployment, especially in countries reliant on international trade, such as Chile, Australia and Canada, as well as Germany. The promised age of shorter hours and electric leisure turned into soup kitchens and bread lines. The collapse exposed fraud and excess. Electricity entrepreneur Samuel Insull, once Thomas Edison‚Äôs prot√©g√© and builder of Chicago‚Äôs Commonwealth Edison, was at one point worth US$150 million ‚Äì an even more staggering amount at the time. But after Insull‚Äôs empire went bankrupt in 1932, he was indicted for embezzlement and larceny. He fled overseas, was brought back, and eventually acquitted ‚Äì but 600,000 shareholders and 500,000 bondholders lost everything. However, to some Insull seemed less a criminal mastermind than a scapegoat for a system whose flaws ran far deeper. Reforms unthinkable during the boom years followed. The Public Utility Holding C",

From leaked customer records to stolen source code, our digital lives keep spilling into the open. Git services are especially vulnerable to cybersecurity threats. These are online hosting platforms that are widely used in the IT industry to collaboratively develop software, and are home to most of the world‚Äôs computer code. Just last week, hackers reportedly stole about 570 gigabytes of data from a git service called GitLab. The stolen data was associated with major companies such as IBM and Siemens, as well as United States government organisations. In December 2022, hackers stole source code from IT company Okta which was stored in repositories on GitHub. Cyberattackers can also quietly insert malicious code into existing projects without a developer‚Äôs knowledge. These so-called ‚Äúsoftware supply-chain‚Äù attacks have turned development tools and update channels on git services into high-value targets. As we explain in a new conference paper, our team has developed a new way to make git services more secure, with very little impact on performance. We already know how to keep conversations private: secure messenger services such as Signal and WhatsApp use end-to-end encryption, which locks messages on your device and only unlocks them on the recipient‚Äôs device. This protects the data even if the service platform is hacked, which is why it‚Äôs considered the gold standard to protect data. But git services, which are widely used by major tech companies and startups, currently don‚Äôt use end-to-end encryption. The same is true for most of the other tools we use to work together, such as shared documents. Because git services allow a huge number of collaborators to work on the same project at the same time, the software codes they host are constantly written and updated at a very rapid rate. This makes using standard encryption impractical. To do so would take up too much bandwidth to transmit all of the data for even one word change, and make the services very inefficient. But our new encryption method overcomes this challenge. The method we have developed uses what‚Äôs known as ‚Äúcharacter-level encryption‚Äù. This means only edits to a software code stored on the git service are treated as new data to be encrypted ‚Äì rather than the entire code. Think of it as encrypting the tracked changes in a word document, instead of a new version every time. This method strikes an important balance. It keeps the updated code private and secure while reducing the amount of communication between user and git services, as well as the amount of storage required. Importantly, this new method is also compatible with existing git services, making it easy for people to adopt. It also doesn‚Äôt interfere with other functions of git servers, such as hosting, saving bandwidth and indexing, so people can keep using these servers as they normally would ‚Äì just with the added benefit of extra security. This new tool is currently free and open-source for all users. It can be installed easily like a patch when using git services, and will run in the background as users access git services just like before. But this is just the starting point for a broader shift towards online collaboration that is secured by end-to-end encryption. Extending the same guarantees to shared documents, spreadsheets and design files is possible, but will require sustained research and investment. One complication to ensure security is managing encryption keys or credentials for users to decrypt encrypted data. Fortunately, our previous research shows us how to create a secure cloud storage system that will allow users to safely store their credentials. Just as importantly, we must balance security with compliance and accountability. Universities, hospitals and government agencies are required to retain and, in some cases, provide lawful access to certain data. Meeting these obligations, without weakening end-to-end encryption, pushes us to research new techniques. The goal is not secrecy at all costs, but verifiable controls that respect both privacy and the rule of law. We don‚Äôt need a brand new internet to get there. We need pragmatic upgrades that fit the tools people already use ‚Äì paired with clear, provable guarantees",

Of course not, but you will in the upcoming episode of YouTube's hit series Celebrity Substitute, in which the Latin superstar trades his tour wardrobe for a trench coat and glasses, stepping in as a disguised substitute teacher to deliver a surprise lesson in salsa music and dance. With a wink to his theatrical side, Rauw enters dressed like a 1970s detective and briefcase in hand. \"What's up, class!\" he says in a deadpan voice, before the room explodes in wave of shocked laughter and applause as students realize who's standing in front of them, as you can see in this exclusive clip for The Latin Times. He is there to teach about \"the Caribbean and the Caribbean sound. Salsa, What is Salsa. They are going to learn what is salsa today,\" he explains as the describes dance and salsa dance in particular as \"freedom.\" Of course, Rauw ends the lesson the only way he knows how: with a full-blown dance party, with Rauw's new song Mirando Al Cielo, as the soundtrack. The clip is part of Season 2 of Celebrity Substitute, which premiered September 10 and continues rolling out new episodes every other Wednesday through December. The show, hosted by Julian Shapiro-Barnum (Recess Therapy) and executive produced by EGOT (Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, Tony) winners Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (Ampersand), brings celebrities into real classrooms to surprise students with unexpected lessons on all kinds of topics, from music to literature and science to self-expression. Rauw's episode is set to debut on this Wednesday, October 8, joining a star-studded lineup that includes Ren√©e Rapp, Role Model, Gigi Hadid, Ed Sheeran, Malala Yousafzai, and more. Rauw Alejandro's surprise teaching moment comes on the heels of a major artistic and personal chapter. In late September, he released Cosa Nuestra: Cap√≠tulo 0, a conceptual album rooted in salsa, reggaet√≥n, and Afro-Caribbean rhythms, and a continuation of his 2024 record Cosa Nuestra. The project was praised for blending nostalgia with experimentation and for honoring Latin musical lineage. Just weeks earlier, Rauw was honored with the Hispanic Heritage Award for Vision, recognizing his impact on global Latin culture and his genre-expanding contributions to music. His Cosa Nuestra World Tour 2025 has drawn sold-out crowds across Latin America, the U.S., and Europe. In that context, his turn as a substitute teacher feels both playful and intentional. Produced in collaboration with Amazon, each Celebrity Substitute episode includes a moment where the company clears items from a featured teacher's Amazon Classroom List, a new tool designed to streamline how educators request materials and receive support. Viewers can directly contribute to real classrooms, transforming surprise celebrity moments into tangible resources for teachers and students. \"Celebrity Substitute works because it pairs joy with generosity,\" said Julian Shapiro-Barnum. \"Rauw brought heart, rhythm, and soul to his lesson, and the kids were all in.\" With his signature charisma, a salsa playlist, and a message of cultural pride, Rauw Alejandro reminds us that Latin music doesn't just fill stadiums, it inspires classrooms, too.

      "full_text": "The Government is to potentially provide ‚Ç¨9 million next year towards hosting the Ryder Cup golf competition in Ireland. Funding is also being targeted towards the long-planned bypass of the village of Adare in Co Limerick, where the Ryder Cup is scheduled to be held in 2027. Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Culture and Sport Charlie McConalogue said there will be a significant increase in funding for major sporting events. He told The Irish Times there are a number of line items in the budget for such events, but the Ryder Cup is the most significant of these. ‚ÄúWe are very much looking forward to hosting (the event) in two years, and there is ‚Ç¨9 million projected at this point for the Ryder Cup,\" he said. ‚ÄúThe countdown to Ireland hosting the 2027 Ryder Cup and Euro 2028 is firmly on, and we will continue to invest in these and other major sports events in 2026. Ensuring that these events leave a lasting legacy for communities, drive economic growth, and impact positively on sports participation will continue to be a priority.‚Äù Separately, Minister for Public Expenditure Jack Chambers said funding will be provided for the Adare bypass road in Co Limerick. Funding for the Adare bypass was one of a number of projects announced as part of an overall ‚Ç¨19.1 billion investment in capital projects in Budget 2026. This represents an increase of ‚Ç¨2 billion on the 2025 figure. Mr Chambers said this allocation would provide the funding to progress ‚Äúthousands of new build social homes, major water infrastructure projects and flood relief schemes, build sustainability and resilience in our electricity grid, boost our electricity supply and major projects across the transport, health, education, justice, arts and sport sectors‚Äù. He said ‚Ç¨7.2 billion in capital funding would be allocated to housing. This includes ‚Ç¨2.9 billion to support the delivery of thousands of new build social homes and the second-hand acquisitions programme. It also incorporates ‚Ç¨1.2 billion for a starter homes programme, which aims to deliver thousands of starter homes through a range of supports alongside the Help to Buy initiative. The Minister said ‚Ç¨300 million will support the regeneration of towns and urban areas. The Government will give ‚Ç¨1.4 billion to Uisce √âireann to ‚Äúcontinue to build essential capacity to support new housing developments and to increase the resilience and sustainability of water supply‚Äù, he said. This will ‚Äúhelp to further progress development of waste treatment plants across the country‚Äù, he said. Some ‚Ç¨3.5 billion will be allocated to ESB and EirGrid to ‚Äústrengthen our energy security and accelerate our transition to renewable energy‚Äù, the Minister said. Capital funding for next year will also progress delivery of more than 300 school building projects, most of which are expected to be finished in 2026 and 2027, he said.",

      "full_text": "By Daniel Villar Pardo Updated on October 07, 2025 After joining Inter Miami in the 2023-24 season, Jordi Alba became a key player for the team. At 36 years old, he managed to remain the undisputed left back, despite competition from younger players. He has not only been a key part of the defensive line, but also a key part of the offense. Despite this, Jordi recently announced his retirement at the end of the season, prompting Lionel Messi to leave a heartfelt comment on his post. On his Instagram profile, Jordi Alba posted a video announcing his retirement at the end of the season with Inter Miami, with the caption ‚ÄúThank you soccer, thank you for so much.‚Äù Lionel Messi was quick to react, ‚ÄúThank you, Jordi. I‚Äôm going to miss you a lot. After so many things together, it‚Äôs going to be strange to look to my left and not see you there‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs crazy how many assists you gave me over all these years‚Ä¶ Who‚Äôs going to give me the back passes now???‚Äù. Throughout his career, Jordi Alba has established himself as one of Lionel Messi‚Äôs most effective partners, with the duo contributing to an impressive 48 goals together. Their connection transcended mere statistics, however, as their intuitive on-field understanding consistently generated scoring opportunities in every match. This synergy undoubtedly ranks him among the most formidable teammates in Messi‚Äôs career. Jordi Alba has cemented his legacy at Inter Miami since joining as a veteran presence. Over 95 appearances, the Spanish full-back has tallied 14 goals and 28 assists, showcasing his extraordinary influence on the pitch. As the Herons advance in the 2025 MLS Playoffs, Alba‚Äôs contributions could help steer them toward their first-ever MLS Cup triumph, marking a milestone in franchise history. Jordi Alba of Spain poses for a photograph with the UEFA Nations League trophy. Over an illustrious 18-year career, Jordi Alba has carved out a legacy as one of the premier left-backs in Spanish soccer. Initially beginning his career as a left winger, he found his true calling at Valencia CF, where his transformation into a left-back drew the attention of FC Barcelona. In 2012, the Catalan giants‚Äîwhere Alba had trained as a youth‚Äîbrought him back to the fold, cementing his status as one of the most significant players in their storied history. see also How many trophies has Jordi Alba won?

      "full_text": "Topic:Federal Government Anika Wells was hammered with questions about the government's response to the outage on Tuesday. (ABC News: Matt Roberts) Australia's telecommunications companies will be subject to a surprise outage simulation to test their triple-0 systems. The drill was agreed to during a meeting between the minister and the heads of Optus, TPG and Telstra, which coincided with the introduction of a bill to enshrine a so-called \"Triple Zero Custodian\" ‚Äî one of the key recommendations in a report handed down 18 months ago. A telecommunication expert believes such a custodian could go a long way to prevent extended outages like the recent Optus incident, which has been linked to a number of deaths. The adequacy of Australia's emergency call network will be stress tested with a surprise drill ahead of bushfire season, as the opposition ramps up its assault over the communication minister's handling of last month's fatal triple-0 outage. Communications Minister Anika Wells summoned the bosses of Australia's telecommunications companies to Parliament House on Tuesday, almost three weeks after a 13-hour Optus outage was linked to multiple deaths in South Australia and Western Australia. She emerged from the meeting with a list of priority actions aimed at bolstering the network against further disasters and an agreement from the telcos to submit to a simulated outage facilitated by the National Emergency Management Agency, which the government wants to see happen within weeks. Ms Wells said the drill would identify \"where this system is not currently working for people\", while she put the blame for the recent outages squarely on the Singaporean-owned telco. \"The only thing that could have stopped Optus from having this outage was Optus themselves,\" she said in Question Time, as she withstood a barrage of questions about her response to the incident from the opposition benches. Details of how the test will function are still being worked out and Shadow Communications Minister Melissa McIntosh expressed surprise that such drills were not already occurring. Melissa McIntosh has called for an independent investigation into the incident as well as a public register of triple-0 outages. (ABC News: Matt Roberts) \"You would think that telcos would be doing this anyway, that it would be a responsibility for them to be checking their systems,\" she said. \"I don't know that it will particularly change things, and the expectation is already there that they do that.\" The meeting ‚Äî which the telco chiefs described as \"constructive and important\" in a joint statement afterwards ‚Äî coincided with the government's introduction of a bill to give a so-called \"Triple Zero Custodian\" powers to oversee the entirety of the system. A custodian was one of the key recommendations of the Bean Review, which was commissioned in the aftermath of an earlier Optus network outage that impacted 10 million customers and handed down 18 months ago, sparking questions over why it was not enshrined sooner. Shadow Communications Minister Melissa McIntosh said she only received a draft of the bill the night before it was introduced, describing the short time for review as \"unusual\". The Coalition agrees with the need to introduce a triple-0 custodian in principle, but support for the bill remains subject to partyroom approval. \"Of course we support the intent of the legislation, we want to protect Australians ‚Ä¶ but the government has been sitting on the recommendations of the Bean Review for a year and a half,\" Ms McIntosh said. \"And then all of a sudden they want to rush legislation through the parliament, so we have questions about their intent. \"I would hate for the legislation just to be a bureaucratic answer ‚Ä¶ we want things to actually make a difference to the triple-0 network.\" The government accepted all 18 of the Bean recommendations when the report was handed down, but a year and a half later, Ms Wells said five were still yet to be fully implemented. Telecommunications experts have had mixed opinions on whether the recommendations, if they were in place, would have prevented the Optus outage, but associate professor Paul Gardner-Stephen from the Flinders College of Science and Engineering believes a Triple Zero Custodian \"makes all the sense in the world\". He argued that was because during the September outage, it appeared as if the failed calls had not been monitored by Optus and \"that's exactly the kind of thing the Triple Zero Custodian, you imagine, would be monitoring and making public, in fact\". Under that scenario, he said, the custodian could immediately raise the alarm, notify senior levels of the telco and instruct them to launch a critical incident response without the hours-long delay that occurred in reality. \"It would be orders of magnitude faster; instead of it being 13 hours, I would have thought that within 13 minutes, under a triple-0 custodial regime, Optus would have been alerted,\" he said. \"The balance of probab",

      "full_text": "Topic:Oil and Gas Mark Vasella says BlueScope Steel workers ‚Äî and Australia ‚Äî face industrial decline without a gas reservation policy. (ABC Illawarra: Tim Fernandez) In a speech to the National Press Club today, Mark Vassella will warn Australia is at risk of following the UK's industrial decline. He and other industry leaders say without cheaper gas, the federal government's Future Made in Australia policy is doomed. Mr Vassella's address will build pressure on the government as it reviews the gas market. Australia's biggest manufacturers have warned the nation's \"broken\" east coast gas market could cost thousands of jobs and derail the government's Future Made in Australia policy. In a speech to the National Press Club in Canberra today, BlueScope Steel chief executive Mark Vassella will warn Australia risks repeating the United Kingdom's industrial decline if the federal government fails to fix the gas market. He said the UK's experience ‚Äî driven by high energy costs and poor policy decisions ‚Äî should serve as a \"cautionary tale\" for Australia. \"Australian manufacturing is at a dangerous crossroad,\" Mr Vassella said. Australian manufacturing is facing a worrying future, says Mr Vasella. (Supplied: GFG Alliance) \"Major change is required to fix our broken gas market and reinstate a fair domestic price. \"If we can't, we face a decline in manufacturing, similar to that which we've seen in the UK steel industry.\" Mr Vassella, a member of Manufacturing Australia, is urging the federal government to adopt an east coast gas reservation policy and a $10-a-gigajoule price cap to guarantee affordable supply for domestic manufacturers. The industry group says reserving even one-third of current east coast production would be enough to meet domestic manufacturing and residential needs, while still allowing most gas to be exported. It says immediately reserving uncontracted gas would bring rapid relief for east coast manufacturers struggling with soaring energy costs. Mark Vasella is taking his message to the National Press Club. (Kelly Fuller) \"Despite our massive gas reserves, Australia has one of the highest wholesale gas prices among producer nations in the world,\" Mr Vassella said. \"Worse, the adoption of a pricing mechanism that is based on LNG export prices means that local gas users are effectively paying for export infrastructure they don't use. \"This is not right. It increases local gas prices and puts local gas users at a structural disadvantage.\" Mr Vassella also calls for new gas supply to be brought online quickly. Frustration in the sector is at boiling point after years of policy interventions that have failed to bring down prices. Mr Vassella's National Press Club address will heap pressure on the federal government, which is conducting a gas market review due later this year. Manufacturers argue that, despite gas demand across eastern Australia falling by about 20 per cent in a decade, they are still paying some of the highest prices in the world. Last year, the average price for wholesale gas in Australia was an average $10.30 a gigajoule, compared with $2.20 in Qatar and $3 in the United States. Manufacturing Australia ‚Äî which includes executives from major gas users such as BlueScope Steel ‚Äî says the federal government's $12-a-gigajoule wholesale gas cap has failed to deliver. \"The intention was for that to be a cap ‚Äî it's not; it's effectively a floor,\" Manufacturing Australia chief executive Ben Eade told ABC News. Mr Eade said newer offers were typically more expensive. The slump in eastern Australia gas prices per gigajoule since 2023. (Supplied: Australian Energy Producers) Mr Eade said some manufacturers were facing contract offers of up to $20 a gigajoule. \"It shouldn't be controversial to say that in a country like Australia ‚Äî which is awash with gas ‚Äî we should be able to supply domestic customers first, while still maintaining a thriving and globally significant export industry,\" he said. \"This isn't a choice between the two, but for the past 10 or 15 years, we've effectively chosen the interests of exporters over those of domestic customers.\" The sector's frustration is backed by the ACCC's gas inquiry September interim report, which found recent federal interventions ‚Äî including the gas market code, the heads of agreement with LNG exporters and the domestic gas security mechanism ‚Äî had delivered \"no material improvement\" for major users. Gas demand in eastern Australia has been falling across most sectors for the past decade. (Supplied: IEEFA) The regulator also warned supply shortfalls could re-emerge by mid-2026 if uncontracted LNG continues to be shipped offshore. Joshua Runciman, lead analyst for Australian gas at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), said east coast prices were high because the market was tightly linked to international LNG. \"LNG prices have increased quite a lot in recent years.

      "full_text": "Netflix, Disney+ and the other major streamers will have to dial down the volume on their commercials in California after Governor Gavin Newsom signed a law banning advertisements that are louder than the main video content being watched. The move, which builds on Congress‚Äô Commercial Advertisement Loudness Mitigation (CALM) Act passed in 2010, would require streamers to comply with the volume limits starting July 1, 2026. ‚ÄúWe heard Californians loud and clear, and what‚Äôs clear is that they don‚Äôt want commercials at a volume any louder than the level at which they were previously enjoying a program,‚Äù Newsom said in a statement. The legislation comes after the Federal Communications Commission has received thousands of complaints in the past several years about loud commercials on broadcast, cable, and satellite television. In February, the FCC said the number took a ‚Äútroubling jump last year, which warrants a second look.‚Äù Senator Thomas Umberg, who is the author behind the legislation, said it was inspired by his legislative director, Zach Keller, who complained that loud streaming commercials were waking up his infant daughter, Samantha. ‚ÄúSB 576 brings some much-needed peace and quiet to California households by making sure streaming ads aren‚Äôt louder than the shows we actually want to watch,‚Äù Umberg added. Umberg‚Äôs bill initially faced opposition from The Motion Picture Association and Streaming Innovation Alliance, who represent the major entertainment conglomerates. ‚ÄúUnlike in the broadcasting cable network environment, where advertisers sell their ads directly to the networks, streaming ads come from several different sources and cannot necessarily or practically be controlled by streaming platforms,‚Äù MPA vice president of state government affairs, Melissa Patack said in testimony last year. ‚ÄúThe technology that encodes and inserts ads from advertisers and third party intermediaries into programming occurs in real time.‚Äù At the time, Patack noted that the Audio Engineering Society and the Interactive Advertising Bureau were already working address loudness issues and develop best practices to match the loudness of ads with programming. She added that many streaming services publish audio specifications to advertisers, ad networks and ad exchanges and request source coding from advertisers so that they can make ‚Äúreasonable efforts to normalize ad loudness.‚Äù The opposition was later dropped after Umberg amended the bill to add legal provisions that would protect streamers from lawsuits from private entities and leave enforcement to the state attorney general‚Äôs office. Representatives for the MPA, SIA, Paramount and Prime Video declined to comment. Netflix, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, Peacock and Apple TV+ did not immediately return TheWrap‚Äôs request for comment.",

      "full_text": "It didn‚Äôt take long for OpenAI‚Äôs text-to-video-and-audio AI generator app, Sora 2, to melt down into a messy pile of potentially copyright-infringing AI slop. Within just days, the TikTok-style app‚Äôs mind-numbing feed of AI-generated content was filled with videos of Nickelodeon‚Äôs SpongeBob SquarePants cooking up blue crystals in a meth lab, entire episodes of South Park, and depictions of physicist Stephen Hawking being brutalized in horrible ways. The app‚Äôs prominent use of recognizable intellectual property and the likenesses of real people, combined with its sheer amount of hype, has allowed it to shoot up to the top of Apple‚Äôs App Store, with Meta‚Äôs competing Vibes app, which was released less than a week before Sora 2, quickly turning into a long-forgotten footnote in AI slop history. All that success creates a problem for OpenAI: how to stop Sora 2 from burning through cash as users generate countless resource-intensive AI videos. In an update posted to his personal blog, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman admitted that the company had a lot of work to do, especially when it comes to turning its AI slop generator into a moneymaker. ‚ÄúWe are going to have to somehow make money for video generation,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúPeople are generating much more than we expected per user, and a lot of videos are being generated for very small audiences.‚Äù It‚Äôs a pressing issue for the firm because of the sheer amount of computing power needed to generate AI videos. Last month, researchers from the open-source AI platform Hugging Face found that the energy demands of text-to-video generators quadruple when the length of videos doubles, suggesting the power required increases quadratically, not linearly. Multiply those demands by the number of videos being generated on Sora 2, and OpenAI is likely looking at massive compute demands. In other words, OpenAI‚Äôs foray into slop-based social media could quickly turn into a very costly endeavor. And turning Sora 2 into a source of revenue won‚Äôt be easy. It‚Äôs not clear that users will actually pay to use the service ‚Äî and adding to OpenAI‚Äôs woes, rightsholders could soon be asking questions about its eyebrow-raising ask-for-forgiveness-later approach to intellectual property and content moderation. The company has since slammed on the brakes, implementing guardrails on Sora 2 that were mysteriously absent on day one, as copyright lawyer Aaron Moss pointed out in a recent article. Users are running into the company‚Äôs content blocks at full force, resulting in widespread frustration. As Altman‚Äôs blog post indicates, the company doesn‚Äôt have a fleshed-out plan on how to generate revenue. Some of the proceeds, according to the CEO, will be shared ‚Äúwith rightsholders who want their characters generated by users.‚Äù But where those proceeds will come from ‚Äî presumably, either from advertising or users ‚Äî remains unclear. ‚ÄúThe idea ‚Äî perhaps similar to YouTube‚Äôs ad-monetization program for videos that include copyrighted material ‚Äî would give studios a financial incentive to opt in,‚Äù Moss wrote in his piece. ‚ÄúWhen thousands of GPU-intensive ten-second ‚ÄòSouth Park‚Äô clips also risk copyright lawsuits, the math gets ugly fast,‚Äù he added. But if ‚Äústudios become partners rather than adversaries, OpenAI can potentially offset costs while buying legal cover.‚Äù Wooing rightsholders to OpenAI‚Äôs side, especially now that the company has allowed for potentially copyright-infringing material to proliferate widely, is far easier said than done. Indeed, major rightsholders have already filed lawsuits against generative AI companies. Case in point, just last month, Warner Bros. Discovery sued AI text-to-image generator company Midjourney for infringement, joining Disney and NBC Universal. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a world of difference between studios collecting YouTube ad revenue on video clips they produce and control, and handing over their characters for anyone to freely manipulate in exchange for a few bucks,‚Äù Moss wrote. Other netizens pointed out that copyright holders may balk at OpenAI‚Äôs courting attempts. ‚ÄúWhy on earth would any brand pay for their IP to be surfaced by a user prompt upon their requests?‚Äù one argued. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs not even close to how any of this works.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy would I, as a multibillion-dollar rightsholder, not just take you to the cleaners?‚Äù another user added.

      "full_text": "Space travel is not for the weak. Astronauts endure motion sickness, disorientation, cardiovascular stress√¢¬Ä¬îand that‚Äôs before they even reach orbit. Luckily, the bacteria that lives inside us is far more resilient. A new study shows that a gut bacteria essential for human health can survive the stress of being launched into space aboard a rocket, the microgravity environment, and reentry into Earth‚Äôs atmosphere. A group of scientists in Australia launched spores of Bacillus subtilis, a gram-positive bacteria that lives in our intestinal tracts, to the edge of space to see how the microbes fared. Upon examination after the bacteria had returned to Earth, the scientists found the microbes had experienced no change in their ability to grow and that their structure remained intact. The findings are detailed in a study published Monday in npj Microgravity. The work indicates that the bacteria would likely work as needed inside the guts of any humans on their way to Mars√¢¬Ä¬îcrucial information for astronaut health. But it also suggests that human-led contamination of Mars with Earthly bacteria may be inevitable. Previous experiments on board the International Space Station (ISS) have shown that certain types of bacteria can survive in space. There hasn‚Äôt been much research done, however, on the effects of a rocket launch and reentry on the survival rates of human gut bacteria. In order to put the bacteria to the test, the researchers packed spores on board a sounding rocket and launched it to an altitude of around 160 miles (260 kilometers) above the surface of Earth. During the second stage burn, the rocket experienced a maximum acceleration of 13 G (or 13 times the force of Earth‚Äôs gravity). Once it reached its desired altitude, the researchers initiated a brief period of weightlessness that lasted for around six minutes as the main engine shut off. After that, the rocket began its descent to Earth, decelerating at forces up to 30 G while spinning at a rate of 220 times per second. After the grueling journey, the researchers examined the bacteria spores to see how they fared during the rocket launch and reentry. Surprisingly, the bacteria showed no change to their structure, nor did the extreme forces affect its ability to grow. ‚ÄúOur research showed an important type of bacteria for our health can withstand rapid gravity changes, acceleration and deacceleration,√¢¬Ä¬ù Elena Ivanova, a professor at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology in Australia, and co-author of the study, said in a statement. ‚ÄúIt√¢¬Ä¬ôs broadened our understanding on the effects of long-term spaceflight on microorganisms that live in our bodies and keep us healthy. This means we can design better life support systems for astronauts to keep them healthy during long missions.‚Äù The idea of bacteria surviving and thriving on their way to the Red Planet, however, isn‚Äôt always met with enthusiasm. The findings follow a separate study published last year which warned bacteria not only have the potential to survive a trip to Mars, but also feel right at home in the Martian soil.√Ç As space agencies plan for human missions to Mars, there is growing concern that those missions could contaminate the Martian environment with out Earthly microbes. That could lead to mistaken discoveries of life on the planet, but it could also pose an immediate risk to the astronauts themselves√¢¬Ä¬îor indeed, any life that might be on Mars in the first place.",

Samsung Amazon (65-inch) Walmart (55-inch) We've tested several of the best OLEDs this year that rank among the top screens we've ever seen, but Samsung's S95F is special. Its secret weapon is Samsung's latest anti-reflective screen, which does a phenomenal job keeping all but the most intense direct reflections at bay, while only minimally affecting black levels and perceived depth. Pair that with breakthrough OLED brightness, near-infinite contrast, fantastic colors, and pristine picture processing, and you've got the best premium TV for any environment. It doesn't support Dolby Vision, but otherwise, there's nary a trick this TV doesn't cover, including top-notch gaming features to make it an all-around dazzling entertainment centerpiece. TCL Amazon Walmart TCL Best Buy TCL's QM6K (8/10, WIRED Recommends) doesn't blast you with brightness, but its utilization of TCL's all-new screen tech provides a remarkably balanced picture, offering sweet and naturalistic colors, impressive image processing, and impressive black levels with very little noticeable blooming. The TV offers plenty of other benefits, including an intuitive Google TV interface, along with topline gaming features like VRR at up to 144 Hz across two of its four HDMI inputs. It's a whole lot of goodness for your money, making it one of the best bargains you'll find. TCL Amazon Walmart We're huge fans of TCL's full-sale display revamp for 2025, which is a big reason two of its top TVs made our deals list. The QM8K is a major step up from the QM6K in brightness (we're talking like four times brighter) for a dazzling picture and vivid colors, while still maintaining excellent black levels, making it a great watch in any setting. This is premium performance for a mid-tier price, especially now that it's on sale, alongside great features and an even speedier Google TV interface. It's still not going to compete with our favorite OLED TVs when it comes to black levels or off-axis viewing, but it gets pretty dang close for your money, making this a steal of a deal.

      "full_text": "Every time Jason publishes a story, you‚Äôll get an alert straight to your inbox! By clicking ‚ÄúSign up‚Äù, you agree to receive emails from Business Insider. In addition, you accept Insider‚Äôs Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. Netflix's \"Monster: The Ed Gein Story\" appears to have taken some creative liberties when depicting the making of Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho.\" Ryan Murphy's twisted anthology series, which focuses on different infamous killers each season like Jeffrey Dahmer and the Menendez brothers, turns to the granddaddy of them all for season 3: Ed Gein, the 1950s-era serial killer who inspired horror classics like \"Psycho\" and \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.\" A majority of episode two of \"The Ed Gein Story\" focuses on a series of events that suggest Gein's crimes inspired Hitchcock. The legendary filmmaker, played by Tom Hollander on the show, is shown having meetings with \"Psycho\" author Robert Bloch and even walking his star Anthony Perkins (Joey Pollari) through a replica of Gein's house on the \"Psycho\" set to get him in the right mindset to play Norman Bates. But according to Tony Lee Moral, who has written several books on Alfred Hitchcock and his movies, many of the details of this episode are a Ryan Murphy fantasy. In one scene, Perkins believes he's having rehearsals with his costar Janet Leigh, but Hitchcock surprises the actor by bringing him to the \"Psycho\" set and showing him a replica of the Gein house as it was found when the police arrested him. Along with the disheveled house having shrunken heads in the living room and a skull bowl in the sink, Hitchcock has Perkins open the freezer to find female genitalia. Perkins is in shock that Hitchcock would show him this, and the director tells him that he chose him for the role because, like Gein, he knows Perkins lives with a secret. (At the time of making \"Psycho,\" Perkins was a closeted gay man). Perkins then exits the house and vomits on the studio lot. \"There is no historical record of Hitchcock ever reconstructing Ed Gein's house or walking Anthony Perkins through it,\" Moral told Business Insider. \"This sequence in Ryan Murphy's series is best understood as dramatic license, not history.\" Although Hitchcock's \"Psycho\" is based on Bloch's book of the same name, and Bloch's mother-loving serial killer is loosely inspired by Gein, in reality, the filmmaker drew even less inspiration from Gein to create his classic horror movie. In \"The Ed Gein Story,\" Hitchcock is depicted as a man captivated by Bloch's tales of Gein's antics. But in truth, the director left most of the story structure to \"Psycho\" screenwriter Joseph Stefano. \"He left me pretty much on my own,\" Stefano is quoted as saying in \"The Dark Side of Genius: The Life of Alfred Hitchcock.\" Instead, Stefano leaned more into how the master of suspense made his movies than digging into Gein research. \"He wanted to talk about almost anything else but the job at hand,\" Stefano said of working with Hitchcock. \"And I felt that if it was going to be done the way he wanted, I'd have to see his films, so I asked to have a number of them screened for me.\" The fact that the \"Psycho\" production would have had enough budget to create a detailed replica of Ed Gein's house ‚Äî despite the fact that the set would never appear in the movie ‚Äî is unfounded. \"'Psycho' was made under a shoestring budget of $800,000 and filmed with Hitchcock's television crew,\" said Moral, referring to the crew Hitchcock already had for his TV series \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents.\" \"The Bates house and motel were built by his design team as fictional constructs, not replicas of the Gein farmhouse.\" Moral also points out how unlikely it is that Hitchcock would go to these kinds of lengths for one of his actors, given that the director once famously described actors as cattle. \"Hitchcock largely avoided discussing character motivations with his actors and deplored method acting,\" Moral said. \"It's also very unlikely that Hitchcock told Perkins that he cast him for his hidden homosexuality. Perkins was likely cast because he was known for playing boy-next-door types, and Hitchcock loved to subvert the audience's expectations and shock them with contrast, which is why he killed Janet Leigh, the major star, less than halfway through the movie.\" Netflix and a rep for Ryan Murphy did not respond to requests for comment. Though \"The Ed Gein Story\" depicts Perkins puking his guts out, in actuality, he was fond of working on \"Psycho\" and even starred in its three sequels. \"I enjoyed making 'Psycho,'\" Perkins said in \"The Dark Side of Genius.\" \"In fact, I accepted the film before I'd even read the script. [Hitchcock and I] got on very well, and he let me make several changes and suggestions. It was my idea that I should eat candy throughout the film. I thought it would be more interesting if the killer were a compulsive candy-eater.\" The Hitchcock/Perkins subplot concludes in episode three, with Perkins coming to terms with the fact t",

      "full_text": "Via @nickysmokes TikTok/NFL TikTok Via @nickysmokes TikTok/NFL TikTok Audio By Carbonatix Heading out for a night at the bar means assembling your squad. Whether you‚Äôre headed out on a night of debauchery or just want an evening with the boys, everyone has their own part to play. Maybe you‚Äôre the funny guy; maybe you‚Äôre the gregarious type that turns a small hang into a group event. No matter who you are, you play an essential role in keeping the night going and the people happy. However, if you‚Äôre looking for someone to add to your crew, one user on TikTok recently sparked discussion with his recommendation: a ‚ÄúRyan Fitzpatrick.‚Äù But what does that mean? In TikTok user Nicky‚Äôs video, which currently has over 57,000 views, he says that adding a ‚ÄúRyan Fitzpatrick‚Äù to a friend group is essential. ‚ÄúThere is nothing better than having a Ryan Fitzpatrick in your friend group,‚Äù Nicky (@nickysmokes) states. ‚ÄúYou know, the guy that‚Äôs almost 40. He‚Äôs been in the league for 20 years. You would think he has a ring by now and he‚Äôs ready to retire, but he‚Äôs not. He‚Äôs just hopping from bar to bar like Ryan Fitzpatrick hopped from team to team.‚Äù The reasons for having such a character, Nicky says, are many. First, they have experience. Second, they take chances. Third, they do not fear rejection. Finally, as Nicky puts it, ‚ÄúHe loves the game.‚Äù ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs nowhere else he‚Äôd rather be than out there on the field with his men, ready to go to battle,‚Äù Nicky summarizes. Nicky closes by reiterating that every crew should at the very least consider adopting an ‚Äúunc.‚Äù ‚ÄúIf you do not have a Ryan Fitzpatrick in your friend group, you are missing out, brother, because that man is a leader,‚Äù he shares. ‚ÄúThat man is the culture. That man will lead you through battle.‚Äù If you read the past few paragraphs wondering who Ryan Fitzpatrick is, well, you probably haven‚Äôt watched football for a while. That‚Äôs because Fitzpatrick was a solid player for a long, long time. How long? Try 17 seasons before announcing his retirement in 2022. During that time, he had some pretty major accomplishments. He played at least one game across nine different NFL teams. He was the first NFL quarterback to throw for over 400 yards in three consecutive games. He also has the most career passing yards and touchdowns of any NFL quarterback without a post-season appearance. That depends. On the field, Fitzpatrick was known for consistently giving it his all and rallying the team, even into his 17th season. He was also, given his experience, fairly older than his teammates. While the average age of an NFL player is just around 26, Fitzpatrick began his last season approaching his 39th birthday. So, are you comfortable having someone significantly older than you in the friend group? A decent amount of people are. Some studies have found that about four in 10 people have an intergenerational friendship. However, whether adding a ‚ÄúRyan Fitzpatrick‚Äù leads to greater social success will depend on your Fitzpatrick‚Äîand your friend group. There‚Äôs nothing better than having a Ryan Fitzpatrick in your friend group #jokes #dating #football #nfl #unc ‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì Nickysmokess In the comments section, some users said they could envision themselves getting their own Ryan Fitzpatrick. Others realized that they were, in fact, their group‚Äôs Ryan Fitzpatrick. ‚ÄúUs unc got all the good stories. Can‚Äôt tell you how many crazy situations I got myself into lmao,‚Äù wrote a user. ‚ÄúI fear this is me. Plenty of playoff runs, no ring, currently on a 7 day bender,‚Äù offered another. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm the fitzmagic of my friends,‚Äù declared a third. ‚ÄúI fear most groups don‚Äôt have one,‚Äù noted a further TikToker.

      "full_text": "While most drivers are guilty of occasionally breaking local road rules, Aussies are sharing the bad driving habits they can't shake. Although most Australian drivers try their best to abide by the road rules, new data has revealed the most common bad driving habits that Aussies can't shake. In a recent survey conducted by AAMI Insurance, which polled more than 1000 local drivers, approximately nine in 10 Australian drivers admitted to driving while distracted. RELATED: ‚ÄòThey‚Äôre the worst‚Äô: The Australian state with the worst drivers Concerningly, 38 per cent of respondents admitted they had been involved in an accident (or had a near miss) due to losing attention, with one in four drivers stating they were ‚Äúpreoccupied‚Äù by a smartphone or smart watch while driving. Additionally, 60 per cent ‚Äì or two-thirds ‚Äì of Australians confessed to being distracted by playing with their music or GPS, while a whopping 65 per cent admitted to eating or drinking a non-alcoholic drink behind the wheel ‚Äì which is technically against the rules. The survey also found 40 per cent of motorists were preoccupied by other road users, including accidents and even pedestrians. Despite less than half of the respondents admitting to gawking at an accident, AAMI motor prevention manager Mary Kennedy said more than 60 per cent blamed other drivers for the same behaviour. ‚ÄúThis shows we tend to be biased towards our own behaviours, believing we are safer drivers compared to others,‚Äù Kennedy said. ‚ÄúAustralian drivers view their own behaviour behind the wheel through rose-tinted glasses.\" Despite knowing they're in the wrong, the report found almost a quarter of participants said they refused to change their bad behaviour unless they had a personal experience with road trauma. According to a report commissioned by the Australian Automobile Association ‚Äì the national industry body ‚Äì distracted driving accounts for approximately 16 per cent of serious road crashes. ‚ÄúDistracted driving is as serious a problem on Australian roads as drink driving. It impairs reaction time (including braking and swerving) and diminishes the ability to maintain speed and lane position,‚Äù the report concluded. However, it‚Äôs not just distracted driving that should be a cause for concern, as motorists also admitted to other dangerous driving habits. A survey of more than 1000 Australian motorists by Compare the Market found speeding was the second-most cited behaviour (24 per cent) behind eating and drinking while driving (27 per cent). Conversely, approximately 18 per cent of participants admitted to driving under the speed limit, while 13 per cent of respondents confessed to having road rage. A whopping 61 per cent of Australians surveyed said they were victims of road rage in the form of another driver‚Äôs use of angry gestures (27 per cent), tailgating (25.6 per cent), as well as yelling and shouting (20.3 per cent).

A Letter From The Captain ‚úçÔ∏èDarlington Nagbe has announced he will retire at the end of the 2025 season. pic.twitter.com/GOHNeyzOS0 At 35, Nagbe‚Äôs career reads like a masterclass in consistency and positional intelligence. Drafted second overall in the 2011 MLS SuperDraft out of the University of Akron, he became the first-ever player selected by the Portland Timbers in their modern MLS era. Over seven seasons and more than 200 appearances, Nagbe steadily transformed from a promising rookie into a club legend. Role Model. Leader. LE6END üíé pic.twitter.com/UXSfJ976vR His crowning achievement in Portland came in 2015, when he helped lead the club to its first MLS Cup title‚Äîa triumph that solidified his place among the league‚Äôs elite. Nagbe‚Äôs ability to retain possession under pressure and control the game‚Äôs tempo gave Portland a tactical edge few midfielders could replicate. BREAKING: Columbus Crew midfielder and MLS legend Darlington Nagbe is retiring after the 2025 MLS season, per sources.Nagbe, 35, is a four-time MLS Cup winner (2015, 2018, 2020, 2023) with three clubs (Portland, Atlanta, Columbus).One of MLS's best-ever midfielders üëè pic.twitter.com/g6DE8ZAYhq In 2018, Nagbe joined an ambitious Atlanta United side and seamlessly integrated into one of the most electrifying squads in league history. Across three seasons and 74 appearances, he linked up with stars like Miguel Almir√≥n and Josef Mart√≠nez to capture the 2018 MLS Cup‚Äîironically defeating his former team, Portland, in the final. Nagbe‚Äôs contribution went beyond stats. His composure, crisp distribution, and ability to dictate rhythm embodied the classical midfielder archetype. The following year, he added a U.S. Open Cup title to his growing trophy collection, further solidifying his status as one of the league‚Äôs most quietly dominant players. At 30, Nagbe returned to his home state to join Columbus Crew‚Äîushering in what would become perhaps the most defining chapter of his career. Over five seasons and 212 matches, he became the club‚Äôs beating heart, helping deliver MLS Cup titles in 2020 and 2023, and the 2024 Leagues Cup. But it wasn‚Äôt just about silverware. Nagbe became a locker room leader, a mentor to younger teammates, and the cultural backbone of the Crew. His presence was felt not only in midfield but across the club‚Äîon the field, in training sessions, and throughout the Columbus community. A Midfield Titan Across Three Clubs Nagbe may not top the charts for goals or flashiest highlights, but few players have ever matched his consistency, influence, and tactical intelligence. To have anchored three separate MLS clubs‚Äîeach of them lifting major trophies during his tenure‚Äîis a rare feat. As the 2025 season winds down, Darlington Nagbe walks toward retirement not just as a champion, but as a standard-bearer of what elite midfield play can look like in MLS. His legacy, built on calm in chaos and unshakable control, will endure long after his final match.",

      "full_text": "Amazon made a bizarre move by editing guns out of the James Bond posters, which has left fans perplexed. Earlier this year, Amazon MGM Studios paid $1 billion to get creative control over the James Bond franchise. Ever since Dr. No was released in 1962, the Broccoli family has led the 007 films. Now, there‚Äôs a big question mark surrounding one of the longest-running franchises. After Daniel Craig‚Äôs final outing, No Time To Die, was released in 2021, fans have been eager to find out what‚Äôs next for the franchise. Who will play the character? Will the tone shift back to the earlier film‚Äôs more exaggerated fun style, or stick with the darker themes from the Craig era? Ever since Amazon took control in February, fans have been concerned about Bond‚Äôs future. With these new altered posters, their apprehension is only growing. As you can see in the post below, Bond posters that once included guns now show the former Bonds in awkward positions. While Amazon has not explicitly said why this choice was made, it‚Äôs likely due to the current political climate. ‚ÄúJust being disarming, darling‚Äùhttps://t.co/41P6Tkg2PK pic.twitter.com/KQQYif7d0q Gun control is one of the biggest hot-button issues out there. Mass shootings have become commonplace in the United States, while the people in charge refuse to take gun reform seriously. The topic has only become more heated in recent weeks due to the assassination of Charlie Kirk. The right-wing podcaster was previously quoted as saying gun deaths were ‚Äúworth it‚Äù to protect the Second Amendment. The fact that he was killed by a gun has only fueled the debate, leaving both sides of the aisle more passionate about their stance than ever. Likely, Amazon didn‚Äôt want one of its biggest franchises to be instantly associated with guns. The problem? James Bond is a spy, and having a gun is a huge part of his identity. Bonds fans are confused about Amazon‚Äôs choice to remove guns from the posters. People were already skeptical about the sale, and this decision isn‚Äôt helping. ‚ÄúI still can‚Äôt believe that Amazon thought it was a good idea to photoshop the James Bond posters to erase the gun from them. The absurdity of the reasoning leaves me speechless,‚Äù one fan wrote. Je n‚Äôen reviens toujours pas qu‚ÄôAmazon se soit dit que c‚Äô√©tait une bonne id√©e de photoshoper les affiches des James Bond afin d‚Äôy effacer le flingue. L‚Äôabsurdit√© de la r√©flexion me laisse sans voix. pic.twitter.com/XQUuTWKZHl ‚ÄúHey @AmazonMGMStudio, WTF is wrong with you? Get your [expetive] together and fast. You‚Äôre about to alienate your core fanbase and destroy the franchise you paid billions for. Bond is an ASSASSIN. He is NOT a GQ model. This is what creative control looks like? Are you total idiots?‚Äù another fan wrote. Hey @AmazonMGMStudio , WTF is wrong with you? Get your sh*t together and fast.

It‚Äôs clear the backlash was loud enough that they realized their mistake. However, the damage is done when it comes to shaking up people‚Äôs faith in their ability to lead the longstanding franchise. The biggest test for Amazon will ultimately be the Bond casting. There have been rumors swirling over the last couple of years with names ranging from Tom Holland and Aaron Taylor-Johnson to Richard Madden and Henry Cavill. Whoever the next 007 is, Amazon has some big shoes to fill from the Broccoli family. The internet is chaotic‚Äîbut we‚Äôll break it down for you in one daily email.

      "full_text": "The clock is ticking for Windows 10. For the past decade, it's been the operating system of choice for millions of PC gamers, offering a (relatively) stable and reliable platform for countless virtual adventures. But as of October 14, 2025, Microsoft is officially ending support for Windows 10. This means if you're still clinging on to the old OS, it's time to seriously consider making the jump to Windows 11. Ignoring the upgrade could leave you vulnerable to security risks and, more importantly for gamers, potentially out in the cold when it comes to your favorite titles. Before continuing, it‚Äôs worth noting that you don‚Äôt have to upgrade to Windows 11 right away - you can continue using a Windows 10 device, it‚Äôll just be unsupported. However, using Windows 10 after October 14, 2025, poses significant risks for PC gamers. Without updates, security vulnerabilities will increase, threatening personal data. Game compatibility and performance will decline as developers cease optimization, leading to lower frame rates, crashes, and eventually, the inability to run new games, effectively rendering the system obsolete. For many PC gamers, the news of Windows 10 reaching its end of life casts a long shadow over the cherished and often extensive digital game libraries they've cultivated over the years. A paramount concern revolves around compatibility: will the vast collection of titles on platforms like Steam still function as expected? What about popular, ongoing live-service games such as Roblox, which demand consistent updates and online connectivity? Initially, there's good news: many existing platforms and individual games are likely to continue running, at least for a transitional period, on an unsupported Windows 10 operating system. However, this is unsustainable in the long term. Sign up for breaking news, reviews, opinion, top tech deals, and more. The cessation of official support from Microsoft for Windows 10 initiates a gradual but inevitable decline in its viability as a gaming platform. Without the security patches, bug fixes, and underlying system optimizations that come with active support, the operating system becomes increasingly vulnerable and less efficient. More critically for gamers, this lack of official backing means that software developers, including those responsible for game engines, development tools, and, crucially, the games themselves, will eventually cease to guarantee compatibility with Windows 10. While gaming giants like Valve (the company behind Steam) haven't issued an explicit statement regarding an end to Windows 10 support, the industry trend is clear. Major platforms will inevitably align their development roadmaps with actively supported operating systems. This means that future updates to the Steam client, or other launchers like Epic Games Store, might introduce features or technical requirements that are not fully compatible with an outdated Windows 10 device. Gamers could find themselves unable to access new platform features, or even facing issues with the client itself. Game developers, from independent studios to large AAA publishers, operate on finite resources. Their development and optimization efforts will naturally prioritize Windows 11, which offers the latest security features, and performance enhancements. If you continue to game on Windows 10, you may face the following issues: In essence, while the transition may not be immediate or sudden, the end of life for Windows 10 marks the beginning of a slow but undeniable process where PC gamers remaining on the unsupported OS will likely be left behind. Their gaming experience will degrade, characterized by declining performance, unaddressed issues, and an eventual inability to participate in the latest and greatest offerings the gaming world has to offer. The incentive to upgrade to a supported operating system, primarily Windows 11, will become increasingly compelling as these challenges mount. Upgrading to Windows 11 is not just about staying current; it's about future-proofing your gaming experience. Don't get caught out when your favorite games stop playing nice with your old OS.
