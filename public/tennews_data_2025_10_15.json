      "description": "Joining Annette Young, Hassan Mneimneh argues that what we are now witnessing in Gaza is not a sudden eruption but the continuation of a long-standing internal logic: Hamas\u2019s drive to police collaboration, suppress the slightest dissent, and maintain its own version of \"law and order\" rule across the Strip. The renewed crackdown on perceived collaborators, he says, does not reflect suppressing a popular uprising. Are the peace plan's two key demands: disarmament and an end to occupation, unachievable? And here is where the deal unravels: Israel demands demilitarization but cannot relinquish security control; Hamas regards armed resistance as an inalienable right under occupation. With neither side willing to compromise, Mr. Mneimneh concludes, the second phase of the peace plan might be doomed to fail. Mr. Mneimneh is a Researcher at The Washington Institute  and a Scholar at the Middle East Institute.",

      "description": "Powell gave two strong signals that liquidity will soon be injected into the market.",
      "content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is not known for giving decisive hints. Still, on Tuesday he did something rare: he openly acknowledged the rising \u201cdownside risks to unemployment\u201d in a clearly dovish signal that the central bank is preparing to ease monetary policy.\u00a0\nPowell\u2019s speech, delivered at an event for the National Association for Business Economics (NABE), was nominally about the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. However, it concluded with a carefully placed shift in tone: the labor market is weakening faster than previously thought, inflation is no longer the sole threat, and policy may finally need to \u201ctake another step toward a more neutral stance.\u201d\nOn Wall Street, there was little debate about what that meant\u2014investors online rejoiced that \u201cPowell is Dovish!\u201d\nAnother crypto page on X exclaimed that the stage is set \u201cfor a parabolic Q4.\u201d\u00a0\nPowell\u2019s comments caused a kick-up in the Dow Tuesday afternoon, climbing nearly 400 points after having fallen 600 throughout the day due to trade tensions.\u00a0\n\u201cPowell signals end of balance sheet rolloff\u2014QT\u2014in September and affirms market expectations for more rate cuts in October and December,\u201d economist Diane Swonk wrote on X shortly after the speech, meaning that the rate-cut cycle is approaching. Investors expect with near certainty that the Fed will cut rates by 25 bps during October\u2019s meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool.The KPMG chief economist noted that, in \u201cclassic Powell humility,\u201d he acknowledged the Federal Reserve had been slow to halt monetary expansion in 2021 after several rounds of post-pandemic stimulus fueled inflation.\nA shift driven by labor market risk\nIndeed, the Fed has spent more than two years fighting sticky inflation with the most aggressive tightening cycle since the 1980s. In a moment of rare institutional self-reflection, Powell conceded that the Fed kept its balance sheet expansion going too long during the pandemic.\n\u201cWith the clarity of hindsight, we could have\u2014and perhaps should have\u2014stopped asset purchases sooner,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nThat acknowledgement shows Powell is keenly aware of the cost of acting too slowly\u2014and may now be erring on the side of avoiding a recession rather than crushing the last 0.9 percentage points of inflation to get the inflation rate down to the Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\u00a0\nPowell noted that the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure\u2014core PCE\u2014is running at 2.9%, but said much of the recent bump in goods prices reflected tariffs as opposed to intrinsic inflationary pressure. That line was not accidental. It distances price pressures from monetary policy and gives the Fed cover to cut rates without appearing to surrender on inflation.\nFor a Fed Chair who prefers restraint, this was messaging with intent. The fight against inflation isn\u2019t over, but the Fed just acknowledged a new reality: jobs now matter as much as prices, and policy has to catch up.\nJobs present more of a risk now\nBut Powell acknowledged Tuesday that the central bank\u2019s dual mandate\u2014stable prices and maximum employment\u2014has suddenly started pulling in the other direction.\n\u201cIn this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\u201d Powell said.\nPayroll growth has slowed sharply, participation has dipped, and both business and household surveys show declining confidence in job availability, he added. Those are prime economic conditions to set up policy easing.\u00a0\u00a0\nBalance sheet runoff ending\nPowell added another doveish signal: an end to the Fed\u2019s balance-sheet runoff, or quantitative tightening (QT), as soon as September. The Fed has been shrinking its portfolio of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities at a pace of up to $95 billion per month in an effort to drain excess liquidity from the financial system.\nBut Powell warned reserves are now \u201cgradually tightening,\u201d and he emphasized the need to avoid a repeat of the 2019 funding squeeze, when interbank lending markets buckled. To avoid a repeat, he told the market exactly what it wanted to hear: QT is almost over, and soon more liquidity will be injected into the market.\n\u201cWe will set policy based on the evolution of the economic outlook and the balance of risks, rather than following a predetermined path,\u201d Powell told investors.\u00a0\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "url": "https://fortune.com/2025/10/14/internet-then-ai-now-imf-world-economic-outlook-growth-gdp/",
      "source": "Fortune",
      "description": "IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said \u201cthe tariff shock is here, and it is further dimming already weak growth prospects.\"",
      "content": "The U.S. and global economies will grow a bit more this year than previously forecast as the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs have so far proved less disruptive than expected, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday, though the agency also said the extensive duties still pose risks.\nThe United States\u2019\u00a0economy\u00a0will expand 2% in 2025, the IMF projected in its influential semiannual forecast, the World Economic Outlook. That is slightly higher than the 1.9% forecast in the IMF\u2019s\u00a0last update in July\u00a0and\u00a01.8% in April. The U.S. should grow 2.1% next year, also just one-tenth of a percent faster than its previous projection, the IMF said.\nIts current forecasts are still down from a year ago, however, a sign that the international lending agency expects the tariffs to weaken the U.S. economy, in part by creating more uncertainty for businesses. Last October, the IMF forecast the U.S. would grow 2.2% this year.\nAll the projections also represent a slowing from 2024, when the U.S. economy expanded at a faster 2.8%.\nThe global economy, meanwhile, will grow 3.2% this year, up from a 3% estimate in July, the IMF forecast, and 3.1% in 2026, the same as its previous estimate.\nWhile the U.S. and world economies have fared better than expected, it\u2019s too soon to say they are fully in the clear, the IMF said, as Trump has continued to make tariff threats and it can take time for changes in international trade patterns to play out.\nOn Friday, for example, Trump threatened to\u00a0slap 100% duties\u00a0on all imports from China, which caused a sharp fall in the stock market.\nIMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said at a news conference that the import taxes and\u00a0ongoing threats to impose more duties\u00a0have created ongoing uncertainty for many businesses and are weighing on the world economy.\n\u201cThe tariff shock is here, and it is further dimming already weak growth prospects,\u201d he said.\nGourinchas also said that a burst of investment in artificial intelligence, in the form of huge data centers and extensive computing power, has helped offset the drag from trade and boosting the U.S. economy. Yet if a financial market bubble formed and then burst, it could sharply slow business investment and consumer spending, he said.\n\u201cThere are echoes in the current tech investment surge of the dot-com boom of the late 1990s,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the internet then, it is AI now.\u201d\nShares of two companies active in the AI sector, AMD and Oracle, which announced\u00a0an expanding partnership Tuesday, have seen their shares rise 80% this year.\nGains in AI-related stock values have lifted Americans\u2019 wealth and fueled consumer spending, Gourinchas said, just as companies are ramping up their investments in advanced computer chips and building data centers. Hotter spending and investment could push central banks to raise interest rates over time, he said.\nGourinchas also offered several reasons the U.S. and global economies have remained resilient after the widespread imposition of tariffs earlier this year.\n\u201cFirst and foremost, the tariff shock itself is smaller than initially feared, with many trade deals and exemptions,\u201d he said. \u201cMost countries also refrained from retaliation, keeping the trading system open. And the private sector also proved agile, front-loading imports and rerouting supply chains.\u201d\nBy front-loading imports, many U.S. companies were able to stock up on goods before the duties took effect, enabling them to avoid or delay price increases.\nYet many of those factors only reflect \u201ctemporary relief, rather than underlying strength in economic fundamentals,\u201d the IMF\u2019s report said.\nThe IMF also said that import price data in the U.S. shows that so far importers and retailers are paying most of the tariffs, not overseas companies, as many Trump administration officials have predicted. Over time, those firms are likely to pass on more of the price hikes to consumers, the report said.\nThere are signs that some downsides of the higher tariffs are starting to emerge, the IMF outlook said. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, has ticked up to 2.9%, according to the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure, up from 2.7% a year ago. Hiring has ground to nearly a halt, which could partly reflect a more cautious approach by many firms in the wake of the uncertainty created by the higher tariffs.\nThe IMF\u2019s forecasts are modestly more optimistic than many private-sector economists\u2019 expectations. The National Association for Business Economics, a group of academic and business economists, on Monday forecast that the U.S. would grow just 1.8% this year and 1.7% in 2026.\nNearly two-thirds of the economists surveyed by the NABE said they think the administration\u2019s duties are nevertheless slowing growth, by up to a half-percentage point.\nChina, meanwhile, has weathered the hit from U.S. tariffs by sending more of its goods to Europe and Asia, rather than the United States, the IMF said. Its currency has depreciated, which has made its exports cheaper. The IMF is forecasting that China\u2019s economy will expand 4.8% this year and 4.2% in 2026, the same as in July.\nGourinchas said that China\u2019s economy has grown increasingly dependent on exports, while its real estate sector continues to struggle under heavy debt loads.\n\u201cIt is increasingly hard to see how this could be sustained,\u201d he added.\nIn Europe, Germany is bolstering growth by increasing government spending to build up its military, Gourinchas said. The IMF now expects the 20 countries that use the euro to grow 1.2% this year, up from a 1% forecast in July, and 1.1% next year, the same as three months ago.\nThe IMF is a 191-nation lending organization that works to promote economic growth and financial stability and to reduce global poverty.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "url": "https://fortune.com/2025/10/14/amazon-layoffs-pxt-hr-andy-jassy/",
      "source": "Fortune",
      "description": "Amazon's 10,000-plus employee HR division, which includes recruiters, is expected to be among the hardest hit in the job cuts.",
      "content": "Amazon is preparing to cut as much as 15% of its human resources staff, with additional layoffs likely in other divisions, according to multiple sources familiar with the plans.\u00a0\nTwo sources told Fortune that Amazon\u2019s human resources division\u2014known internally as PXT or the People eXperience Technology team\u2014will be hard hit, but that other areas of Amazon\u2019s core consumer business are also likely to be affected. It couldn\u2019t be learned how many employees in total Amazon plans to let go, nor the exact timing of the cuts.\nThe company laid off relatively small numbers of employees earlier this year in areas such as its consumer devices unit, its Wondery podcast division, and in Amazon Web Services.\nAmazon spokesperson Kelly Nantel declined to comment.Amazon\u2019s PXT division, which reports to senior vice president Beth Galetti, has more than 10,000 employees worldwide, and includes a large recruiting team, plus technology staff and other traditional HR roles.\nThe new cuts come as Amazon continues to look for ways to lower employee costs while investing aggressively in AI products and infrastructure \u2013 both for internal use and to sell to enterprise customers. The company has said it intends to spend upwards of $100 billion in capital expenditures this year, as it builds out its cloud and AI datacenters.\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy already oversaw the largest layoffs in company history from late 2022 into 2023, when the company cut at least 27,000 corporate jobs, which accounted for a high single digit percentage of the company\u2019s office jobs. Many other Big Tech companies also slashed their headcounts around that time as the pandemic receded and consumer demand trends changed.Now, many employers are looking to harness the power of AI\u2014initially for mundane and repetitive tasks and eventually for more complicated jobs\u2014to reduce the need to maintain the same level of human staffers on their payrolls.Jassy himself is one of them. The CEO fired a bit of a warning shot to his own employees in June, when he encouraged them to welcome this new AI-powered era.\n\u201cThose who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company,\u201d he wrote in a companywide email that was also published on Amazon\u2019s corporate blog.\nAt the same time, Jassy also made a point to note that there won\u2019t be room on the bus for everyone: \u201cWe expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.\u201d\nJassy, who succeeded Amazon founder Jeff Bezos in the CEO job in 2021, has earned a reputation as a cost-cutter (though to be fair, he inherited a company that many say had become wasteful and bloated in some areas). Amazon executives regularly require managers to hit a certain percentage goal for unregretted attrition, or URA \u2013 essentially a percentage of employees that the company would be OK losing, whether through voluntary departures, being \u201cmanaged out,\u201d or through formal layoffs. But sources told Fortune that these cuts are being discussed differently internally than the typical URA process.\nWhile Amazon plans these layoffs of corporate roles, the company announced its typical holiday hiring spree of  warehouse staff on Tuesday. This year, the company will hire 250,000 seasonal employees across its US warehouse and logistics networks. \nAmazon\u2019s stock price is down about a little more than 1% this calendar year, but 15% higher than it was 12 months earlier. The company will report earnings later this month.\nAre you a current or former Amazon employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

Western intelligence has warned that this could eventually increase to thousands.Russia has also expanded its drone bases and launch sites in recent months, further underscoring how the country intends to rely on cheap weapons to bombard Ukraine at long range.These developments, and worsening attacks, have pushed Ukraine to seek out cost-efficient air defenses that match the cheap drone threat without being forced to rely on solely on very expensive guided missiles fired from ground launchers and fighter jets.Helicopters, like the Soviet-era Mil Mi-24 gunship, have emerged as one solution at Ukraine's disposal; the military has published several videos this year showing fixed-wing aircraft shooting down Russian drones. Crew members have filmed the use of Gatling guns and door-mounted machine guns.But Kyiv has also identified another promising solution: interceptor drones, which can hunt and kill Russian drones mid-flight. Ukraine's defense industry has ramped up production of these systems, which are intended to cost roughly the same as their targets \u2014 Russian drones are estimated to be worth tens of thousands of dollars \u2014\u00a0and be deployable at scale.Zelenskyy, in his Telegram statement on Monday, said \"maximum production volumes\" of interceptor drones are needed.Read the original article on Business Insider",

Yet he warns that this moment remains very volatile and the violence continues, albeit at a much lower level: \"There is shooting every day and every moment\" as Hamas seeks to \"take over or take control of the Gaza Strip, not limited to the areas that the Israelis have withdrawn from\". Hamas and other factions violently vie for control. Mr. Zaqout\u2019s own family has lost their home and have sought refuge within the ruins. Gaza\u2019s survival hinges not solely on relief, but on reconstruction, human dignity, and political will to build a new foundation and future.
