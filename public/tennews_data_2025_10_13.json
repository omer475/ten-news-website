      "source": "Fortune",
      "description": "Deloitte Services forecasts holiday retail sales to be up between 2.9% to 3.4% from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31, a slowdown from 2024.",
      "content": "Uncertainty over the economy and tariffs is forcing retailers to pull back or delay plans to hire seasonal workers who pack orders at distribution centers, serve shoppers at stores and build holiday displays during the most important selling season of the year.\nAmerican Christmas LLC, which creates elaborate holiday installations for commercial properties such as New York\u2019s Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall, plans to hire 220 temporary workers and is ramping up recruitment nearly two months later than usual, CEO Dan Casterella said. Last year, the company took on 300 people during its busy period.\nThe main reason? The company wants to offset its tariff bill, which Casterella expects to be as big as $1.5 million this year, more than double last year\u2019s $600,000.\n\u201cThe issue is if you overstaff and then you underperform, it\u2019s too late,\u201d Casterella said. \u201dI think everyone\u2019s more mindful now than ever. \u201d\nHoliday hiring could fall to the lowest level since 2009\nJob placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas forecasts hiring for the last three months of the year will likely fall under 500,000 positions. That\u2019s fewer than last year\u2019s 543,000 level and also marks the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years when retailers hired 495,800 temporary workers, the firm said. The average seasonal gain since 2005 has been 653,363 workers, the firm said.\nAmong other companies cutting holiday payrolls: Radial, which powers deliveries for roughly 120 brands like Lands\u2019 End and Cole Haan and operates 20 fulfillment sites. It plans to hire 6,500 workers, fewer than last year\u2019s 7,000, and is waiting to the last minute to ramp up hiring for some of its clients, chief human resources officer Sabrina Wnorowski, said.\nBath & Body Works, based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, said it plans to hire 32,000 workers, lower than the 32,700 a year ago.\nAmong the bright spots: Online behemoth Amazon Inc. said Monday it intends to hire 250,000 full-, part-time and seasonal workers for the crucial shopping period, the same level as a year ago.\n\u201cWe saw real strong signals that there\u2019s been a cooling in the labor market, even beyond what our expectations were in the first nine months of the year,\u201d Challenger\u2019s senior vice president Andy Challenger said. \u201cWe are having lots of regular conversations with companies about pending layoffs and changes they\u2019re making to their workforce.\u201d\nIn addition to overall economic uncertainty, Challenger noted companies are using\u00a0artificial intelligence\u00a0bots to replace some workers, particularly those working in call centers. And he\u2019s also seeing companies hiring workers closer to when they need them.\nMeanwhile, the list of companies staying mum about their specific holiday hiring goals keeps growing. Target Corp., UPS and Macy\u2019s are declining to offer figures, a departure from the past. UPS had hired 125,000 seasonal hires last year, while Target announced last year it planned to hire 100,000 workers. Macy\u2019s last year said it would hire 31,500 seasonal workers.\nHoliday hiring: the first clues to what\u2019s in store for spending\nRetailers\u2019 hiring plans mark the first clues to what\u2019s in store for the U.S. holiday shopping season and come as the U.S. job market has\u00a0lost momentum this year, partly because\u00a0Trump\u2019s trade wars\u00a0have created uncertainty that\u2019s paralyzing managers trying to make hiring decisions.\nThe\u00a0Labor Department\u00a0reported in early September that U.S. employers \u2014 companies, government agencies and nonprofits \u2014 added just 22,000 jobs in August, down from 79,000 in July and well below the 80,000 that economists had expected.\nThe government shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and has delayed the release of economic reports, could worsen the job picture.\nIn an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues, the White House budget office said Friday that\u00a0mass firings of federal workers have started.\nThe firings are happening as hundreds of thousands are already furloughed and still others are being required to report to duty without pay.\nAnalysts will be closely monitoring the shutdown\u2019s impact on spending. For now, many retailers say that consumers, while resilient, are choosy about what they buying. Analysts will also be closely watching how shoppers will react as retailers push through price increases as a result of high tariff costs in the next few months, experts said.\nGiven an economic slowdown, holiday spending growth is expected to be smaller than a year ago, according to several forecasts.\nMastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods including cash, predicts that holiday sales will be up 3.6% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase during the year-ago period.\nDeloitte Services LP forecasts holiday retail sales to be up between 2.9% to 3.4% from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31. That\u2019s compared to the same year-ago period when retail sales increased 4.2% from the year before.\nAdobe expects U.S. online sales to hit $253.4 billion this holiday season from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, representing a 5.3% growth. That\u2019s smaller than last year\u2019s 8.7% growth.\nA more flexible approach\nGiven the uncertainty, companies increasingly want to hire workers closer to when they need them, experts said.\n\u201cIn today\u2019s environment, brands are really looking for us to be agile,\u201d Radial\u2019s Wnorowski said. \u201cRadial is meeting that need of the customer and the consumer with a more flexible and disciplined approach to hiring.\u201d\nSo for some of its clients, Radial will now be hiring two weeks before Thanksgiving weekend, the traditional start for the holiday shopping season, instead of four weeks before the kickoff, she said. Radial is also speeding up training of holiday hires due to new technology that\u2019s simplifying their tasks. It used to take a couple of days to train a worker, but now it only takes a couple of hours, she said.\nMeanwhile, Target said it\u2019s again embracing a three-prong approach. It starts first by offering current workers additional hours and then taps into a separate pool of workers\u2014 43,000\u2014 who pick up shifts that work for their schedules. The Minneapolis-based company also hires seasonal workers across its nearly 2,000 stores and more than 60 distribution facilities to meet demand, it said.\nFor the past few years, Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer and the largest private employer, has been offering the extra hours available during the holidays to its workers, a Walmart spokesperson said, noting it\u2019s worked well and the feedback from customers and workers has been \u201coverwhelmingly positive.\u201d\nThe Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said there may be some seasonal hiring on a store-by-store basis, but the majority of stores will dole out those hours to current workers.\nLate start plus no economic data could create challenges\nWaiting until the last minute to hire workers could mean a mad scramble to find talent, but companies say that due to the slowing economy, they don\u2019t anticipate having a hard time finding the needed pool.\nMeanwhile, the temporary halting of the release of economic reports leaves retailers in the dark about forecasting sales and the workers they need to meet the demand.\n\u201cCertainly, for our customers not having access to data will put more of a challenge on their ability to forecast,\u201d Wnorowski of Radial said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll stay very close to them as we go into peak and we\u2019ll adjust as soon we see things changing.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "description": "Ukraine's weapons makers are ready to make three times more weaponry, but they are limited by Ukraine's budget. NATO ally Denmark has a way to help.",
      "content": "Ukrainian companies make missiles, drones, ammunition, and other weaponry, and Denmark has started a new initiative to help them boost production.AP Photo/Efrem LukatskyUkraine's defense firms say they can make far more weaponry, but Ukraine doesn't have the budget.A new step by a NATO ally could help ease these concerns, among others.Denmark is offering Ukrainian firms the chance to make weapons on Danish soil with European funding.A NATO ally is offering a workaround to help with some of the biggest problems facing Ukraine's defense.Ukraine's defense output has soared since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, with companies pumping out drones, missiles, air defenses, and ammunition.Ukraine is constantly in need of more weaponry, but companies can only make as much as Ukraine's limited defense budget allows. The industry says that with more funding, it could scale up to more than three times its current output.Denmark's latest initiative is a small but important step toward addressing that problem, allowing Ukrainian manufacturers to produce equipment on Danish soil. It's designed to give Denmark access to Ukrainian tech and to also give those companies the support needed to produce more weapons for Ukraine's defense.By letting Ukrainian firms build weapons on Danish soil, the initiative turns Ukraine's wartime production crunch into a chance to expand its defense footprint abroad \u2014 channeling Danish funding and European stability into more reliable output for the war effort.Denmark's approachDenmark is allocating over $50 million to help firms start operations in the country under its \"Build for Ukraine\" initiative.The country's defense ministry described it as a joint Ukrainian-Danish weapons production project, noting it also benefits Denmark. Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said it will give his country's forces \"easier access to some of the newest technologies and experiences from Ukraine.\"Ukrainian companies, large and small, are making weaponry for the country's fight.Vitalii Nosach/Global Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesThis could be the kind of assistance Ukrainian industry leaders have long called for, arguing that allowing Ukrainian producers to sell weapons to partner nations\u2014 not just to their own government \u2014 lets them scale up and ultimately make more for Ukraine's fight.Ukraine's defense minister, Denys Shmyhal, said in August that the Build for Ukraine plan would also provide more weapons to his own troops, saying it would \"ensure more effective equipping of our warriors with everything they require.\" The joint projects are eligible for EU funding, the defense ministry said.Right now, Ukrainian rules surrounding exports are so stringent that companies and industry bodies working on its defense say that exports are effectively frozen. Denmark's new move could be something of an export opportunity, just via relocation. It opens the possibility for technology, know-how, and intellectual property transfers or collaborative development.That production being on NATO soil provides protection from Russian attacks and aligns with Ukraine's goal of integrating itself more with European militaries and industries. It also reduces security costs, which run high in a country at war.Serhiy Goncharov, CEO of the National Association of Ukrainian Defense Industries (NAUDI), which represents around 100 companies, told Business Insider that his organization wanted Ukrainian companies to be able to work on co-production ventures abroad, and he hopes other European countries will follow in the footsteps of the Danes.Ukraine's government, he said, simply cannot afford to buy \"all of the military production that can be produced in Ukraine,\" and this agreement allows the countries to \"support each other,\" combining Danish resources with Ukrainian expertise to get more equipment for both militaries.So far, only one Ukrainian company is planning to set up new operations in Denmark. Fire Point makes drones, missiles, and other weaponry. In Denmark, it's planning to make rocket fuel. More partnerships are expected, though.Ukrainian-made drones have been a core part of the country's defense, and an area Ukraine wants to make more of.Scott Peterson/Getty ImagesDenmark is eager to learn from Ukrainian companies on tech and swift production models as it and other European countries brace for the possibility of expanded Russian aggression.Poulsen, the defense minister, told BI in February that his country's defense industry has \"a lot to learn from Ukraine.\" He wants collaboration so that Denmark can \"get some of the lessons learned from the defense companies in Ukraine back to Danish defense companies.\"Ukraine's production problemsIt is vital that Ukraine scale up its defense sector and produce more of its own weapons. Throughout the war, Kyiv has faced recurring shortages from Western partners \u2014 either because partners could not afford to send more, didn't have the stockpiles, faced production backlogs, or, in some cases, wavered politically.Relying on its own weaponry allows Ukraine to avoid this problem, as well as the restrictions that partners have at times imposed on the weaponry, making them less useful for Ukraine.However, issues like budget constraints have held it back.Ukraine aims to produce much more of its own weaponry. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this month that more than 40% of the weapons used on the front line are Ukrainian-made. He wants to see that number increase to 50% by the end of the year.Other efforts are underway to help Ukraine ramp up production, like new movement on the possibility of exports abroad.Being able to produce on foreign soil offers valuable protection that reduces the strain on defense companies that are forced to break apart and disperse operations at home to avoid becoming top targets for a Russian attack.\"We try to be smart about it and not create a big enough target for it to attract too much attention,\" the CEO of Ukrainian autonomous systems developer Ark Robotics told Business Insider. The problem is that these preventive measures slow things down and make it hard to scale. The company, he shared, wants to move as much of its production as possible into other parts of Europe.Denmark was already a leader in supporting Ukraine's arms output. It spearheads the \"Danish Model,\" an initiative to buy weapons directly from Ukrainian manufacturers rather than from other European or US firms. That weaponry reaches Ukraine faster and cheaper, without the backlogs plaguing Western producers.That model increased the production of key Ukrainian weaponry, like the 2S22 Bohdana 155mm howitzer, and it keeps growing. However, it's still in its early stages, unable, by itself, to close the gap that Ukraine is struggling to overcome and prompting Denmark and other partner nations to keep seeking additional solutions, like \"Build for Ukraine,\" that can operate alongside it.Read the original article on Business Insider",

It\u2019s expected to last into Monday, authorizing the state\u2019s emergency services personnel to be activated as necessary.\nParts of the state are forecast to experience moderate to major coastal flooding, inland flash flooding, winds up to 60 mph (97 kph), up to 5 inches (about 13 centimeters) of rain and high surf, potentially causing beach erosion. Some volunteers were putting sandbags at beaches.\nThe National Weather Service placed New York City under a coastal flood warning and wind advisory through at least Monday afternoon. Coastal areas of suburban Long Island could see flooding, with up to 3 inches (about 8 centimeters) of rain and lashing winds expected, the weather service said.\nWind gusts of more than 30 mph (48 kph) were already being recorded in the region on Sunday morning.\nSome flight delays and cancellations were announced in airports from Washington, D.C. to Boston.\nThe storm was expected to move out by Monday night.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "content": "As the Middle East broadly welcomes a\u00a0ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war\u00a0in Gaza, Iran finds itself at one of its weakest moments since its 1979 Islamic Revolution.\nTehran has operated its self-described\u00a0\u201cAxis of Resistance\u201dover several decades, supporting militant groups and nations allied with it against Israel and the United States. But as Israel bombed the Gaza Strip, it also turned its crosshairs toward top leaders abroad in militant groups like Hamas, Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah and even the top echelon within Iran\u2019s military and nuclear program \u2014 killing many and disrupting their ability to fight back.\nAs\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0prepares for a Middle East trip that likely will see him praised by Israel and Arab nations, Iran won\u2019t be at the table as it still\u00a0struggles to recover from June\u2019s 12-day war.\nHow Tehran\u2019s theocracy responds in the weeks and months ahead, whether that means lashing out or trying to rebuild its hobbled economy at home, will be crucial.\n\u201cUndoubtedly this is a not a proud moment for Iran,\u201d said Ali Vaez, the Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. \u201cIts alliance system in the region is in ruins but it doesn\u2019t mean that the \u2018Axis of Resistance\u2019 is no more.\u201d\n\u2018Like a bankrupt gambler\u2019\nIranian state media has sought to describe the Gaza ceasefire as a victory for Hamas, despite the war destroying the Gaza Strip and killing over 67,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t differentiate between civilians and combatants but says around half the dead are women and children.\nIran\u2019s Foreign Ministry welcomed \u201cany decision \u2026 that guarantees halting the genocide of Palestinians.\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reiterated that on Saturday, telling state television that Hamas decided to accept the deal and that Tehran has \u201calways supported any plan, any action that led to the halt of crimes, genocide\u201d by Israel against the people of Gaza.\nBut perhaps more tellingly, an adviser to Iran\u2019s 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suggested the ceasefire would only lead to conflict elsewhere in the region.\n\u201cThe start of the ceasefire in Gaza may be the behind-the-scenes end of the ceasefire somewhere else!\u201d Ali Akbar Velayati, an adviser to Khamenei, wrote on X, referencing Hezbollah, Yemen\u2019s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels and Iraq.\nThe fear of further Israeli strikes, particularly on Iran, remains acute in the public\u2019s mind as much of Iranian\u00a0air defenses likely were destroyed by Israel in June. Khamenei has not resumed his usual routine of weekly speeches to audiences. Without explanation, Iran avoided holding a major military commemoration marking the end of the Iran-Iraq war in September, which typically sees top officials watch drones and missile launchers parade past them.\nIran\u2019s\u00a0economy also has suffered under international sanctions and as global energy prices fall.\n\u201cIran has always focused on its interests, we do not have resources anymore, our economy has weakened,\u201d said Tehran-based analyst Saeed Leilaz. \u201cOur support to Hamas was a reaction to U.S. to divert conflicts from our borders.\u201d\nOthers are less optimistic.\n\u201cIran is like a bankrupt gambler after winning some small money in the first rounds,\u201d said Amir Kazemi, a university student in Tehran. \u201cWhen Hamas attacked Israel, Iran was happy about it. But now, after the ceasefire, Iran finds nothing in its pocket.\u201d\nMideast looks far different\nIn the immediate years after\u00a0Iran\u2019s revolution, its theocratic government sought to export its Shiite revolutionary ideology more widely in the Middle East. That morphed following its devastating 1980s war with Iraq into more of an effort to provide a level of deterrence as Arab nations around it purchased sophisticated American bombs, warplanes and tanks that Tehran couldn\u2019t access due to sanctions.\nThe U.S. military\u2019s presence across the Persian Gulf also expanded following\u00a0the 1991 Gulf War, with Arab nations granting basing rights to American forces to Tehran\u2019s constant anger.\nThe peak of the \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d came in the chaotic years after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and Yemen\u2019s subsequent collapse into a civil war. Then, it could count on Hezbollah, Syrian autocrat Bashar Assad, the Houthis, Iraqi militant groups and even Hamas \u2014 a Sunni militant group.\nToday, the Mideast looks far different.\nIn Syria,\u00a0rebels overthrew Assad last year,\u00a0Israeli strikes killed Hezbollah and Hamas\u2019 top leaders, while Iraqi militant groups faded into the background. Yemen\u2019s Houthis, while still capable of launching attacks on Israel and\u00a0commercial shipping in the Red Sea corridor, find themselves now targeted by increasingly precise Israeli strikes.\nAnd the 12-day war in June left Iran likely no longer enriching uranium for its nuclear program, which\u00a0the West long has worried could be weaponized.\n\u2018Collapsing regional clout\u2019\nIran, meanwhile, has yet to receive any major support from either China or Russia, despite providing Beijing with likely discounted oil and Moscow with the drones it uses in its war on Ukraine. Tehran has also shied away from confronting\u00a0women who are increasingly abandoning the hijab, or headscarf, instead executing prisoners it already holds\u00a0at a rate unseen in decades.\n\u201cThe ceasefire is reflective of Tehran\u2019s collapsing regional clout following the unraveling of its long-powerful \u2018Axis of Resistance\u2019 since 2024,\u201d said Ali Fathollah-Nejad, the director of the Berlin-based Center for Middle East and Global Order. \u201cThe ceasefire will free Israeli military capacities that would now be used against Iranian interests \u2014 whether in Lebanon against Hezbollah or directly against Iran.\u201d\nFor his part, Trump seized on Iran accepting the ceasefire as \u201cterrific\u201d news. However, there\u2019s been no move toward renewed public negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program.\n\u201cTime is not on Iran\u2019s side but their problem is no one is really giving them an exit ramp,\u201d Vaez said. But whether Tehran would take the ramp also remains in question as its leaders still debate what turn to now take.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

The powerful cannons are far more than an annoyance. They have injured personnel and damaged equipment. Ramming is also common.There have been boarding incidents that the Philippines have characterized as piracy. Chinese personnel in those incidents even carried bladed weapons. China has also employed dazzlers and acoustic devices in confrontations.The majority of engagements are gray zone aggression below the threshold of war, but these still carry risks.Maneuvers like ramming, blocking, and chasing run a risk of causing a major accident that could, intentional or otherwise, prove fatal. A recent incident came at the expense of China's own ships.TKCourtesy of Jay Tarriela, Philippine Coast Guard SpokespersonIn August, while a Chinese destroyer and a Chinese coast guard vessel were chasing a Philippine patrol boat at high speeds east of the Scarborough Shoal, the destroyer crossed into the path of the coast guard vessel, resulting in a catastrophic collision. Video footage from the incident showed significant damage to the hull of the coast guard ship.Regarding this Sunday's clash, China blamed the Philippines for entering waters that it claims without permission and said a Philippine vessel dangerously approached a Chinese coast guard ship, causing a scrape. China continues to exert its territorial claims over the majority of the South China Sea, which have been called repeatedly into question.China has also had run-ins and confrontations with other militaries in the South China Sea, both at sea and in the air. China routinely dismisses complaints, arguing its actions are lawful and necessary to protect its sovereignty.Read the original article on Business Insider",

This has afforded Moscow more weapons for hunting down trains.Russia has been carrying out attacks against Ukraine's rail network since the early days of the war. However, it began increasing the frequency of strikes in early August, focusing on \"disrupting critical connections,\" Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's prime minister, said earlier this month.Since August, Russia has launched nearly 300 strikes on the Ukrainian railway system, said Oleksii Kuleba, Ukraine's deputy prime minister for restoration, on Sunday in his latest tally of attacks. Officials have said that targets include trains, stations, and other infrastructure.Since the start of the war, 221 railway workers have been wounded and 37 have died while performing their duties by Russian strikes. They have also caused civilian casualties. With the increase in attacks, those numbers could spike. An October 4 strike on a train station left one person dead and 30 more injured.The representative of Ukrzaliznytsia, Ukraine's state-owned railway company, said their understanding is that Moscow's goals are to sow panic among passengers and to disrupt the economy. The recent uptick in attacks has been linked to a rise in Russian drone production, they said.The aftermath of a Russian attack on a Ukrainian train earlier this month.Pavlo Zarva/Kordon.Media/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images\"Previously, they simply did not have sufficient resources for a single combat drone, such as a Shahed, to hunt down a locomotive,\" the railway representative told Business Insider. \"Now they can afford to use Shaheds to hit individual locomotives rather than strategic targets.\"Neither Russia's embassy in the US nor its defense ministry immediately responded to a request for comment from Business Insider on the strike campaign.Russia has significantly scaled up its drone operations this year. The country now produces around 4,000 a month at its factories, and it has been able to attack Ukraine with hundreds of them in its nightly strikes. Western intelligence has warned this could eventually become thousands.Russia has also notably expanded its drone bases and launch sites in recent months in a sign that it is investing heavily in cheap long-range strike capabilities.In an October 4 social media post, Svyrydenko said that Moscow also uses missiles to \"systematically\" attack Ukraine's rail network. \"Alongside their strikes on energy facilities ahead of the winter season, Russia now seeks to sever the very arteries of life in Ukraine \u2014 the routes that carry people, enable medical evacuation, and deliver hope across our country,\" she said.Kuleba said in a statement on the Telegram messaging platform that Ukrzaliznytsia tends to restore infrastructure within just a few hours of attacks and usually gets operations going again later that day.Russia's new campaign against Ukraine's rail network comes as part of the broader expansion of its drone attacks against the country. Over the past several months, it has regularly targeted cities and civilian infrastructure with hundreds of armed and decoy drones, the latter of which are designed to exhaust Kyiv's already strained air defenses.Ukraine, meanwhile, has ramped up its own strike campaign since early August, using long-range drones in attacks on Russian energy infrastructure, including oil refineries. The goal has been to disrupt a key source of revenue that fuels Moscow's war efforts and apply pressure on the Kremlin.Read the original article on Business Insider",

      "description": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said around 10% of the controller workforce is engaging in \"sickouts\" and threatened to fire these \u201cproblem children.\u201d",
      "content": "Airports across the United States have been experiencing significant flight delays recently because of a shortage of air traffic controllers, who have been required to work without pay since a government shutdown began on Oct. 1, 2025. Reports suggest employees have been calling in sick in increased numbers. And since there was already a shortage of controllers before the shutdown, the impact has been severe, with thousands of flights delayed or canceled since the shutdown began.\nThe Conversation U.S. asked Brian Strzempkowski and Melanie Dickman, aviation experts at The Ohio State University, to explain how the shutdown is affecting air travel, what that means for passengers and air safety, as well as the air traffic controller shortage that has been plaguing U.S. airports for years.\nHow is the shutdown affecting air traffic controllers?\nAir traffic controllers are deemed essential workers, meaning they are still required to work while not receiving compensation \u2013 which they would typically then receive in a lump sum after the shutdown ends. President Donald Trump created some uncertainty around this by suggesting workers may not get their back pay without explicit authorization from Congress, despite having signed a law in his first term that makes it a legal requirement.\nWorking without regular pay, combined with the possibility that they won\u2019t get paid at all, is resulting in real financial stress for air traffic controllers, who perform one of the most stressful jobs there is.\nAs a result, there have been reports of air traffic controllers calling in sick in large numbers. This happened in previous shutdowns as well. During the 2018-2019 shutdown, for example, sickouts started to happen around the two-week mark, roughly when the first paycheck was missed. Controllers, airport security employees, and other essential workers were calling in sick often so they could work another part-time job to pay their bills.\nIn the current shutdown, this appears to be happening sooner, less than a week after it began. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said around 10% of the controller workforce is engaging in this practice and threatened to fire these \u201cproblem children.\u201d\nWhat does this mean for people about to take a flight?\nBefore the shutdown, there was already a critical shortage of air traffic controllers. Coupled with workers calling in sick in recent days, this has led to severe travel delays at many major airports, such as those in Atlanta and Denver, and regional ones, like those serving Burbank, California, and Daytona Beach, Florida.\nA big question on travelers\u2019 minds is whether this will affect air safety.\nThe air traffic control system is multi-layered and has redundancies built into it to ensure an incredibly safe environment. While controller shortages do begin to erode some of those redundancies, contingency plans are in place to help protect the system. For example, air traffic can be diverted away from affected locations or delayed, or the flight may even be be canceled before the plane leaves the gate.\nAs an example, Newark Liberty International Airport can accommodate approximately 80 aircraft departing or arriving per hour when the airport and airspace is fully operational. However, due to technical failures, staffing shortages and construction at the airport, capacity was limited to between 28 and 34 aircraft per hour in June 2025. Due to technology upgrades and procedural changes, that number was recently increased to between 68 and 72 aircraft per hour. By regulating the amount of traffic, the system can be protected to ensure the safety of every aircraft.\nThis was an example of high-level oversight in which the secretary of transportation was personally involved in seeking a solution to ensure air travel remained safe while trying to increase capacity.\nHow does the U.S. keep air travel safe?\nOn a more day-to-day level, the Federal Aviation Administration relies on the Air Traffic Control System Command Center, located about 40 miles away from Washington, D.C. This facility oversees the entire national airspace system and essentially \u201ccontrols\u201d the controllers. Air traffic professionals monitor staffing at air traffic facilities, weather conditions, equipment failures and unexpected disruptions to the system.\nWhen an incident arises, such as Burbank Airport recently reporting that no controllers were available, the command center issues an alert stating that any aircraft inbound to Burbank must divert to an alternate airport, and any aircraft that has not yet taken off will be held on the ground.\nStaffing shortages at other air traffic control facilities may require alternate plans, such as transitioning workloads from one facility with fewer controllers, to another that is appropriately staffed. There is a wide range of tools that the Air Traffic Control System Command Center can utilize to protect the system, but it all stems from the idea of managing the capacity. Flight delays and cancellations, while disruptive to individual travelers, are actually good from a system perspective, because they prevent congestion in the airspace.\nWhy was there an air traffic controller shortage in the first place?\nThere has been a systemic problem with hiring of air traffic controllers for more than a decade.\nOver the years, the FAA has fallen behind on training enough controllers to replace those who retire each year. In May 2025, we wrote about the FAA\u2019s plan to utilize colleges across the country to provide the professional training for this career field. While it will take a little time for the students to matriculate through college and into the workforce, this plan will be a significant contributor to solving the controller shortage problem.\nMeanwhile, the FAA Academy, which trains U.S. air traffic controllers, only has limited funding from the previous federal budget for current students. The shutdown means no new students can begin training. Depending on the length of the shutdown, the funding may run out as additional employees are furloughed. The ripple effects of a shutdown can remain for many months after the government reopens.\nWhat\u2019s the government doing to end the shortage?\nIn July, Congress authorized over US$12 billion in funding to help modernize the air traffic control system.\nSecretary Duffy is currently leading an effort to identify a contractor to implement the technology upgrades needed to modernize the system and make it more robust. Duffy has said an additional $19 billion investment will be needed to complete the task.\nBrian Strzempkowski, Assistant Director, Center for Aviation Studies, The Ohio State University and Melanie Dickman, Lecturer in Aviation Studies, The Ohio State University\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "description": "\u201cTo be clear, some of these cuts are going to be painful. This is not a situation that we relish.\"",
      "content": "Vice President JD Vance on Sunday said there will be deeper cuts to the federal workforce the longer the\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0goes on, adding to the uncertainty facing hundreds of thousands who are already furloughed without pay amid the stubborn stalemate in Congress.\nVance warned that as the federal shutdown entered its 12th day, the new cuts would be \u201cpainful,\u201d even as he said the Trump administration\u00a0worked to ensure\u00a0that the military is paid this week and some services would be preserved for low-income Americans,\u00a0including\u00a0food assistance.\nStill, hundreds of thousands of government workers have been furloughed in recent days and, in a\u00a0court filing\u00a0on Friday, the Office of Management and Budget said well over 4,000 federal employees would soon be fired in conjunction with the shutdown.\n\u201cThe longer this goes on, the deeper the cuts are going to be,\u201d Vance said on Fox News\u2019 \u201cSunday Morning Futures.\u201d \u201cTo be clear, some of these cuts are going to be painful. This is not a situation that we relish. This is not something that we\u2019re looking forward to, but the Democrats have dealt us a pretty difficult set of cards.\u201d\nLabor unions have already filed a lawsuit to stop the aggressive move by President\u00a0Donald Trump\u00a0\u2019s budget office, which goes far beyond what usually happens in a\u00a0government shutdown, further inflaming tensions between the Republicans who control Congress and the Democratic minority.\nThe shutdown began on Oct. 1 after Democrats rejected a short-term funding fix and demanded that the bill include an extension of federal subsidies for health insurance under the Affordable Care Act. The expiration of those subsidies at the end of the year will result in monthly cost increases for millions.\nTrump and Republican leaders have said they are open to negotiations on the health subsidies, but insist the government must reopen first.\nFor now, negotiations are virtually nonexistent. Dug in as ever, House leaders from both parties pointed fingers at each other in rival Sunday appearances on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d\n\u201cWe have repeatedly made clear that we will sit down with anyone, anytime, anyplace,\u201d said House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York. \u201cRepublicans control the House, the Senate and the presidency. It\u2019s unfortunate they\u2019ve taken a my-way-or-the-highway approach.\u201d\nHouse Speaker\u00a0Mike Johnson\u00a0blamed Democrats and said they \u201cseem not to care\u201d about the pain the shutdown is inflicting.\n\u201cThey\u2019re trying their best to distract the American people from the simple fact that they\u2019ve chosen a partisan fight so that they can prove to their Marxist rising base in the Democratic Party that they\u2019re willing to fight Trump and Republicans,\u201d he said.\nProgressive activists, meanwhile, expressed new support for the Democratic Party\u2019s position in the shutdown fight.\nEzra Levin, co-founder of the leading progressive protest group Indivisible, said he is \u201cfeeling good about the strength of Dem position.\u201d He pointed to fractures in the GOP, noting that Georgia Rep.\u00a0Marjorie Taylor Greene\u00a0publicly warned last week that health care insurance premiums would skyrocket for average Americans \u2014 including her own adult children \u2014 if nothing is done.\n\u201cTrump and GOP are rightfully taking the blame for the shutdown and for looming premium increases,\u201d Levin said. \u201cTheir chickens are coming home to roost.\u201d\nAnd yet the Republican administration and its congressional allies are showing no signs of caving to Democratic demands or backing away from threats to use the opportunity to pursue deeper cuts to the federal workforce.\nThousands of employees at the departments of Education, Treasury, Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency, are set to receive layoff notices, according to spokespeople for the agencies and union representatives for federal workers.\n\u201cYou hear a lot of Senate Democrats say, well, how can Donald Trump possibly lay off all of these federal workers?\u201d Vance said. \u201cWell, the Democrats have given us a choice between giving low-income women their food benefits and paying our troops on the one hand, and, on the other hand, paying federal bureaucrats.\u201d\nDemocrats say the firings are illegal and unnecessary.\n\u201cThey do not have to do this,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly of Arizona on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cThey do not have to punish people that shouldn\u2019t find themselves in this position.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "url": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/nuclear-energy-taiwan-maanshan-plant",
      "source": "IEEE Spectrum",
      "description": "Taiwan failed to pass an August referendum on whether or not a nuclear plant should be restarted, if it were deemed safe to operate. While the more than 4 million votes for \u201cyes\u201d outnumbered the more than 1.5 million \u201cno\u201d votes, the number of affirmative votes failed to surpass the 25 percent threshold of eligible voters also required for the referendum to pass. As a result, Taiwan remains on the nuclear-free path it has followed since the shutdown of the nuclear plant in question, Maanshan Nuclear Power Plant, in southern Taiwan on 17 May, fulfilling a 2016 government pledge made as a result of Japan\u2019s 2011 Fukushima disaster.However, high-tech industries, including semiconductor manufacturing, AI data centers, and AI infrastructure operators, will continue fueling electricity demand. The question remains as to whether or not Taiwan can deliver reliable clean power to support the growth of these industries amid Chinese geopolitical pressure\u2014and without nuclear energy.Taiwan\u2019s Nuclear Energy DebateTaiwan\u2019s energy landscape remains complex. Nuclear power, developed since the 1970s, has seen older reactors retired since 2018. Taiwan imports 95 percent of its energy and has a growing reliance on natural gas. But it also aims to reduce carbon emissions, improve grid reliability, and expand its energy storage options.\u201cWithout energy, there\u2019s no industrial growth\u2026and nuclear is an excellent option,\u201d Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during a prereferendum visit to Taipei on 22 August. He met with key players in high-tech supply chains, including Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC), the world\u2019s largest chip foundry producing advanced chips for smartphones, high-performance computing, and AI applications.It was not Huang\u2019s first time advocating for nuclear energy. During Computex Taipei in May he said, \u201cWe need energy from any single source: wind, solar, nuclear. Taiwan should absolutely invest in nuclear, and it shouldn\u2019t be a stigma to have energy.\u201dNvidia has been expanding in Taiwan, partnering with Foxconn and the government to build a 10,000-Blackwell GPU AI training and supercomputing facility in the south, opening a larger Taipei office, and collaborating with Taiwanese companies such as TSMC to build an AI infrastructure ecosystem.Taiwan president Lai Ching-te promised to honor the referendum result while focusing on diverse energy sources. He said Taiwan might consider advanced nuclear options if technology improves, waste decreases, and public support grows. In late August, the government approved a draft piece of legislation, the AI Basic Act, designed to create a supportive environment for AI development and use. The draft emphasizes the government\u2019s role in promoting AI research, applications, and infrastructure. Meanwhile, the newly reshuffled Cabinet is under pressure by industry and the broader public to maintain energy security.In mid-September, newly appointed Minister of Economic Affairs Ming-hsin Kung emphasized that Taiwan is a global hub for chips and technology, shaping strategies for the next 10 to 20 years.Taiwan\u2019s Renewable Energy GoalsKung stressed that businesses require both stable power supply and green energy to meet commitments to 100 percent renewable energy from global corporate initiative RE110. He said the new Cabinet will continue focusing on renewable energy while adjusting rollout speed. The goal is to lift renewables to 20 percent of Taiwan\u2019s power supply by the end of 2026\u2014a challenging target critical in keeping Taiwan competitive in global supply chains. He estimated renewable energy will account for around 15 percent of power generation by the end of 2025, up from 11.9 percent in 2024.  A wind turbine and its solar power system are part of the Taipower Exhibit Center in Pingtung, in southern Taiwan on 29 April 2025.I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty ImagesFor solar, Kung pledged to strengthen existing projects, resolve land-use conflicts with fish farms in solar-fishery initiatives, and replace older solar panels with newer ones that produce twice as much energy. Offshore wind construction will be accelerated, and a trial program for floating wind turbines will resume. Taiwan will also actively develop other green energy sources, such as geothermal and hydrogen.On nuclear, Kung reaffirmed Taiwan\u2019s nuclear-free path but left open the possibility of adopting advanced technologies like small modular reactors. Guidelines for evaluating potential restarts of existing plants will be released by the end of October. The first step will see the Taiwan Power Co. (Taipower) conducting assessments of all three halted nuclear plants, with initial results due next year. Maanshan, which began commercial operations in 1984, is regarded as the most likely to pass the safety self-assessments, which will focus on the ability to maintain aging equipment and upgrade earthquake resilience.In a report released on 26 September, Taiwan\u2019s Energy Administration projects electricity demand to grow 1.7 percent annually from 2025 to 2034. The forecast factors in expansions to Taiwan\u2019s semiconductor industry, investments in AI development, and expected energy savings.To meet rising power demand, the government currently plans to boost natural-gas generation while phasing out large nuclear, coal, and oil plants. Net additions of 12.2 gigawatts in gas-fired capacity are expected by 2034.Semiconductor Industry ConcernsBut high-tech industries express concern. In early September, at Semicon Taiwan, Charles Lee, the managing director of Topco Group, a major semiconductor supplier, told IEEE Spectrum that manufacturers worry about grid stability as AI and semiconductor growth accelerates. \u201cHighly polluting coal-fired plants are no longer an option, so we will rely more on liquefied natural gas and less-stable renewables. If nuclear plants could be restarted, I would personally welcome it,\u201d Lee says.Meanwhile, a memory manufacturing director, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he isn\u2019t authorized by his company to speak to the media, told Spectrum that Taiwan\u2019s economy is still manufacturing-driven. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about the low efficiency of green energy. We\u2019ve also noticed a trend abroad, with countries resuming nuclear plant construction,\u201d he says.In a televised debate ahead of the August referendum, Tzu-Hsien Tung, chairman of Pegatron Corp., voiced support for restarting nuclear power plants. He warned that if Taiwan continues to rely on carbon-heavy electricity, local firms could face steep carbon taxes overseas, undermining their global competitiveness.  Visitors view AI server samples at the Zhen Ding Tech Group booth during the Semicon Taiwan exhibition in Taipei on 10 September 2025.I-Hwa Cheng/AFP/Getty ImagesAs Taiwanese society debated whether to restart nuclear power plants, some Taiwanese energy experts, including Tze-Luen Lin, deputy executive director of the Taiwanese government\u2019s Office of Energy and Carbon Reduction and a political science professor at National Taiwan University, have called for fresh approaches to Taiwan\u2019s energy resilience amid ongoing Chinese threats, echoing to notions brought by nongovernmental organizations and think thanks, such as the U.S.-based Center for Climate and Security, that a clean-energy transition can strengthen national security.At the Society for Environmental Economics and Policy Studies conference in Japan on 21 September, Lin highlighted that renewable energy is central to both energy and national security. He emphasized, \u201cEnergy resilience can only be strengthened through decentralized, locally sourced renewables, combined with microgrids and energy storage,\u201d and warned that large, centralized power plants are easier targets for attack.Commenting on Taiwan\u2019s possible nuclear options, Jusen Asuka, a professor at Tohoku University and chair of the session in the conference, cautioned that small modular reactors remain immature and costly, and investing heavily in them could slow renewable-energy development.",

Do the charges appear to have affected his chances of returning to the White House?\nAfter each of Trump\u2019s three prior indictments, his polling numbers changed in small, inconsistent ways \u2014 if they changed at all. The fourth indictment followed this non-pattern pattern: Some evidence suggests that he\u2019s gained ground in the Republican primary, other evidence suggests that he\u2019s lost it, and what little general-election data we have suggests nothing has shifted significantly. And, adding to the frustration of political junkies everywhere, it\u2019s very difficult to figure out how much the fourth indictment affected Trump\u2019s standing in the race given how close it occurred to two other major events on the campaign trail: the third indictment and the GOP presidential debate.\u00a0\nLet\u2019s take a deeper look at national polls of the Republican primary. There have been 29 of these conducted completely after news of the fourth indictment broke late at night on Aug. 14, and Trump has fallen from 53 percent in our polling average to 50 percent since then.9 But the Georgia indictment came on the heels of another big set of charges: On Aug. 1, Trump was indicted by a federal grand jury, also for allegedly interfering with the 2020 election. And only five combinations of pollsters and sponsors conducted polls both in the period between the two indictments (Aug. 1 and Aug. 14) and after the Georgia one (since Aug. 14).10 That\u2019s important because, while we can theoretically compare, say, Emerson College\u2019s Aug. 16-17 survey to its June 19-20 survey, it would be impossible to say that Trump\u2019s 3-percentage-point decline is due to the Georgia indictment. It could have been due to the third indictment, or any other combination of events that occurred over those two months.11\nThen, to make matters even more complicated, only two of those pollsters wrapped their post-indictment poll before the Aug. 23 Republican presidential debate, which also could have shifted views of Trump. And those two disagree about how much the race shifted after the indictment. According to Morning Consult, Trump\u2019s national support among potential primary voters barely budged, from 57 percent to 58 percent. But according to Premise, Trump actually boosted his numbers among Republican registered voters over this period, from 54 percent to 60 percent.\nThat\u2019s not what we see when we look at Trump\u2019s average support, which has decreased \u2014 but that may be linked to the debate, which Trump declined to attend. According to three pairs of polls12 whose first half was fielded after the indictment but before the debate and whose second half was fielded after the debate, Trump\u2019s national support dropped by an average of 4 points. In addition, a FiveThirtyEight/Washington Post/Ipsos poll conducted using Ipsos\u2019s KnowledgePanel found that 5 percent of Republican likely voters who watched the debate were considering voting for Trump before it but not after it, making him the only candidate to lose a significant amount of potential support.\nIt doesn\u2019t look like the fourth indictment changed many minds among the general electorate either. Morning Consult and Premise were again the only two pollsters to ask about a hypothetical general-election matchup between Trump and President Biden during our windows of interest (Aug. 1-14 for the before poll, Aug. 15-23 for the after poll). According to Premise, registered voters preferred Trump to Biden by 4 points before the indictment and by 5 points after it \u2014 not a statistically significant shift. And according to Morning Consult, the results were the same (Biden 43 percent, Trump 41 percent) before and after the Georgia indictment. \nOne more pollster/sponsor pairing \u2014 Ipsos/ABC News \u2014 asked about Trump\u2019s overall favorable and unfavorable ratings both before and after the indictment. In their Aug. 2-3 poll, 30 percent of American adults viewed him favorably, and 59 percent viewed him unfavorably. And in their Aug. 15-16 poll, 31 percent viewed him favorably and 55 percent viewed him unfavorably. That seems like an improvement, but it was within the poll\u2019s margin of error, so it could just be noise.\nTo be sure, a measly three polls conducted 15 months before the election are not the final word on Trump\u2019s fate in the court of public opinion. The case against Trump in Georgia (really, all of his indictments) could hurt or help him more as time drags on, particularly if he is convicted or acquitted before the election. It\u2019s also possible that this entire exercise is flawed, given that the \u201cbefore\u201d polls in this analysis all came within two weeks of Trump\u2019s third indictment; perhaps Trump\u2019s polling numbers in this period were already depressed because of those (similar) allegations.\nBut looking at the big picture \u2014 including FiveThirtyEight\u2019s averages of the national Republican primary and Trump\u2019s overall favorable and unfavorable ratings \u2014 it\u2019s clear that public opinion about Trump has not changed in a major way in several months, even after he was indicted on nearly 100 criminal charges in four different jurisdictions. After what is expected to be his final indictment, he remains the strong favorite in the GOP primary and a competitive candidate in the general election.\nCORRECTION (Aug. 31, 2023, 8:37 a.m.): An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that former President Donald Trump\u2019s support in our national Republican primary polling average was 50 percent when news of his indictment in Georgia broke on Aug. 14. In fact, it was 53 percent.",
