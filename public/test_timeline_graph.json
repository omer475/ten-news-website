      "detailed_text": "The Federal Reserve announced a significant interest rate increase, bringing the federal funds rate to 5.5 percent, the highest level in over two decades. This decision comes amid persistent inflation concerns and a strong labor market. Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated that further rate adjustments may be necessary depending on economic data. The move affects millions of consumers and businesses, with mortgage rates and credit card interest expected to rise. Financial markets reacted cautiously, with stock indices showing mixed responses. Economists are divided on whether this marks the peak of the rate-hiking cycle or if additional increases are needed to combat inflation.",
