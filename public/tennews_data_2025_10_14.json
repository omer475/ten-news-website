      "description": "China holds an unexpectedly strong hand in the trade war, and the U.S.\u2019s tariffs have been counterintuitively positive for China.",
      "content": "Global stock markets fell after China banned certain U.S. shipping firms and U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said \u201cif they want to slow down the global economy, they will be hurt the most.\u201d Asian and European indexes all dropped on the news, and S&P 500 futures are in sharp decline prior to the opening bell in New York.\n\nA broad-based selloff swept global stock markets this morning after U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent told the Financial Times that China \u201cwill be hurt the most\u201d if it doesn\u2019t submit to Washington\u2019s trade demands. At the same time, China showed no signs of backing down from President Trump\u2019s trade war: It imposed sanctions banning Chinese companies from doing business with the U.S. subsidiaries of\u00a0 South Korean shipbuilder Hanwha Ocean. South Korea\u2019s KOSPI fell 0.63% on the news.\nS&P 500 futures were down 0.87% this morning. Markets in Asia and Europe were almost all down, with Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 off 2.58% and Europe\u2019s Stoxx 600 down 0.49% by midmorning.\nBeijing\u2019s new export controls on rare earth materials\u2014which the U.S. is dependent on\u2014are \u201ca sign of how weak their economy is, and they want to pull everybody else down with them,\u201d Bessent said. \u201cMaybe there is some Leninist business model where hurting your customers is a good idea, but they are the largest supplier to the world,\u201d he told the FT. \u201cIf they want to slow down the global economy, they will be hurt the most.\u201d\n\u201cThey are in the middle of a recession/depression, and they are trying to export their way out of it. The problem is they\u2019re exacerbating their standing in the world.\u201d (That last statement is misleading. In fact, China is doing very well. Its exports rose 8.3% in September and the World Bank expects China GDP to grow 4.8% this year. U.S. growth is forecast at 1.4%.)\nThe mood among traders today is a stark reversal from yesterday, when the S&P 500 rose 1.56% after investors realized that Trump and China President Xi Jinping will likely meet at the upcoming APEC conference at the end of October\u2014an opportunity for both men to reach one of Trump\u2019s famous deals\nElsewhere, there wasn\u2019t much to cheer up the markets. One third of bettors on Polymarket think the U.S. government shutdown will go on beyond November 8.\nPantheon Macroeconomics noted that consumer sentiment remains low: The University of Michigan\u2019s consumer survey, which asks whether buyers feel now is a good time to make a major purchase, \u201cnow points to year-over-year growth in this measure of core spending slowing to near-zero soon, a far cry from the 6% pace earlier this year,\u201d according to Samuel Tombs and Oliver Allen.\n\nGoldman Sachs added to the gloom by publishing a note this morning titled \u201cJobless growth.\u201d \u201cThe modest job growth alongside robust GDP growth seen recently is likely to be normal to some degree in the years ahead. We expect the great majority of US potential GDP growth to come from solid productivity growth boosted by advances in artificial intelligence (AI), with only a modest contribution from labor supply growth due to population aging and lower immigration,\u201d authors Pierfrancesco Mei and David Mericle said.\nIn the longer term, however, most analysts continue to see stocks going up, driven largely by the tech and AI sector.\n\u201cRoughly half of this S&P 500 bull has been driven by just seven stocks: Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG/L), Apple (AAPL), Broadcom (AVGO), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and NVIDIA (NVDA),\u201d Jeff Buchbinder and Adam Turnquist of LPL Financial told clients in a note. But, \u201cThe Fed is in the middle of a rate-cutting cycle and inflation appears to be under control despite increased tariffs, likely eliminating that as a potential bull market killer.\u201d\nHere\u2019s a snapshot of the markets ahead of the opening bell in New York this morning:\n\nS&P 500 futures were down 0.87% this morning. The index closed up 1.56% in its last session.\nSTOXX Europe 600 was down 0.47% in early trading.\u00a0\nThe U.K.\u2019s FTSE 100 was flat in early trading.\u00a0\nJapan\u2019s Nikkei 225 was down 2.58%.\nChina\u2019s CSI 300 was down 1.2%.\u00a0\nThe South Korea KOSPI was down 0.63%.\u00a0\nIndia\u2019s Nifty 50 was down 0.42% before the end of the session.\u00a0\nBitcoin was down to $111.8K.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "source": "Fortune",
      "description": "Deloitte Services forecasts holiday retail sales to be up between 2.9% to 3.4% from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31, a slowdown from 2024.",
      "content": "Uncertainty over the economy and tariffs is forcing retailers to pull back or delay plans to hire seasonal workers who pack orders at distribution centers, serve shoppers at stores and build holiday displays during the most important selling season of the year.\nAmerican Christmas LLC, which creates elaborate holiday installations for commercial properties such as New York\u2019s Rockefeller Center and Radio City Music Hall, plans to hire 220 temporary workers and is ramping up recruitment nearly two months later than usual, CEO Dan Casterella said. Last year, the company took on 300 people during its busy period.\nThe main reason? The company wants to offset its tariff bill, which Casterella expects to be as big as $1.5 million this year, more than double last year\u2019s $600,000.\n\u201cThe issue is if you overstaff and then you underperform, it\u2019s too late,\u201d Casterella said. \u201dI think everyone\u2019s more mindful now than ever. \u201d\nHoliday hiring could fall to the lowest level since 2009\nJob placement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas forecasts hiring for the last three months of the year will likely fall under 500,000 positions. That\u2019s fewer than last year\u2019s 543,000 level and also marks the smallest seasonal gain in 16 years when retailers hired 495,800 temporary workers, the firm said. The average seasonal gain since 2005 has been 653,363 workers, the firm said.\nAmong other companies cutting holiday payrolls: Radial, which powers deliveries for roughly 120 brands like Lands\u2019 End and Cole Haan and operates 20 fulfillment sites. It plans to hire 6,500 workers, fewer than last year\u2019s 7,000, and is waiting to the last minute to ramp up hiring for some of its clients, chief human resources officer Sabrina Wnorowski, said.\nBath & Body Works, based in Reynoldsburg, Ohio, said it plans to hire 32,000 workers, lower than the 32,700 a year ago.\nAmong the bright spots: Online behemoth Amazon Inc. said Monday it intends to hire 250,000 full-, part-time and seasonal workers for the crucial shopping period, the same level as a year ago.\n\u201cWe saw real strong signals that there\u2019s been a cooling in the labor market, even beyond what our expectations were in the first nine months of the year,\u201d Challenger\u2019s senior vice president Andy Challenger said. \u201cWe are having lots of regular conversations with companies about pending layoffs and changes they\u2019re making to their workforce.\u201d\nIn addition to overall economic uncertainty, Challenger noted companies are using\u00a0artificial intelligence\u00a0bots to replace some workers, particularly those working in call centers. And he\u2019s also seeing companies hiring workers closer to when they need them.\nMeanwhile, the list of companies staying mum about their specific holiday hiring goals keeps growing. Target Corp., UPS and Macy\u2019s are declining to offer figures, a departure from the past. UPS had hired 125,000 seasonal hires last year, while Target announced last year it planned to hire 100,000 workers. Macy\u2019s last year said it would hire 31,500 seasonal workers.\nHoliday hiring: the first clues to what\u2019s in store for spending\nRetailers\u2019 hiring plans mark the first clues to what\u2019s in store for the U.S. holiday shopping season and come as the U.S. job market has\u00a0lost momentum this year, partly because\u00a0Trump\u2019s trade wars\u00a0have created uncertainty that\u2019s paralyzing managers trying to make hiring decisions.\nThe\u00a0Labor Department\u00a0reported in early September that U.S. employers \u2014 companies, government agencies and nonprofits \u2014 added just 22,000 jobs in August, down from 79,000 in July and well below the 80,000 that economists had expected.\nThe government shutdown, which started Oct. 1 and has delayed the release of economic reports, could worsen the job picture.\nIn an attempt to exert more pressure on Democratic lawmakers as the government shutdown continues, the White House budget office said Friday that\u00a0mass firings of federal workers have started.\nThe firings are happening as hundreds of thousands are already furloughed and still others are being required to report to duty without pay.\nAnalysts will be closely monitoring the shutdown\u2019s impact on spending. For now, many retailers say that consumers, while resilient, are choosy about what they buying. Analysts will also be closely watching how shoppers will react as retailers push through price increases as a result of high tariff costs in the next few months, experts said.\nGiven an economic slowdown, holiday spending growth is expected to be smaller than a year ago, according to several forecasts.\nMastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods including cash, predicts that holiday sales will be up 3.6% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase during the year-ago period.\nDeloitte Services LP forecasts holiday retail sales to be up between 2.9% to 3.4% from Nov. 1 through Jan. 31. That\u2019s compared to the same year-ago period when retail sales increased 4.2% from the year before.\nAdobe expects U.S. online sales to hit $253.4 billion this holiday season from Nov. 1 to Dec. 31, representing a 5.3% growth. That\u2019s smaller than last year\u2019s 8.7% growth.\nA more flexible approach\nGiven the uncertainty, companies increasingly want to hire workers closer to when they need them, experts said.\n\u201cIn today\u2019s environment, brands are really looking for us to be agile,\u201d Radial\u2019s Wnorowski said. \u201cRadial is meeting that need of the customer and the consumer with a more flexible and disciplined approach to hiring.\u201d\nSo for some of its clients, Radial will now be hiring two weeks before Thanksgiving weekend, the traditional start for the holiday shopping season, instead of four weeks before the kickoff, she said. Radial is also speeding up training of holiday hires due to new technology that\u2019s simplifying their tasks. It used to take a couple of days to train a worker, but now it only takes a couple of hours, she said.\nMeanwhile, Target said it\u2019s again embracing a three-prong approach. It starts first by offering current workers additional hours and then taps into a separate pool of workers\u2014 43,000\u2014 who pick up shifts that work for their schedules. The Minneapolis-based company also hires seasonal workers across its nearly 2,000 stores and more than 60 distribution facilities to meet demand, it said.\nFor the past few years, Walmart, the nation\u2019s largest retailer and the largest private employer, has been offering the extra hours available during the holidays to its workers, a Walmart spokesperson said, noting it\u2019s worked well and the feedback from customers and workers has been \u201coverwhelmingly positive.\u201d\nThe Bentonville, Arkansas-based retailer said there may be some seasonal hiring on a store-by-store basis, but the majority of stores will dole out those hours to current workers.\nLate start plus no economic data could create challenges\nWaiting until the last minute to hire workers could mean a mad scramble to find talent, but companies say that due to the slowing economy, they don\u2019t anticipate having a hard time finding the needed pool.\nMeanwhile, the temporary halting of the release of economic reports leaves retailers in the dark about forecasting sales and the workers they need to meet the demand.\n\u201cCertainly, for our customers not having access to data will put more of a challenge on their ability to forecast,\u201d Wnorowski of Radial said. \u201cBut we\u2019ll stay very close to them as we go into peak and we\u2019ll adjust as soon we see things changing.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "content": "Ukrainian companies make missiles, drones, ammunition, and other weaponry, and Denmark has started a new initiative to help them boost production.AP Photo/Efrem LukatskyUkraine's defense firms say they can make far more weaponry, but Ukraine doesn't have the budget.A new step by a NATO ally could help ease these concerns, among others.Denmark is offering Ukrainian firms the chance to make weapons on Danish soil with European funding.A NATO ally is offering a workaround to help with some of the biggest problems facing Ukraine's defense.Ukraine's defense output has soared since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022, with companies pumping out drones, missiles, air defenses, and ammunition.Ukraine is constantly in need of more weaponry, but companies can only make as much as Ukraine's limited defense budget allows. The industry says that with more funding, it could scale up to more than three times its current output.Denmark's latest initiative is a small but important step toward addressing that problem, allowing Ukrainian manufacturers to produce equipment on Danish soil. It's designed to give Denmark access to Ukrainian tech and to also give those companies the support needed to produce more weapons for Ukraine's defense.By letting Ukrainian firms build weapons on Danish soil, the initiative turns Ukraine's wartime production crunch into a chance to expand its defense footprint abroad \u2014 channeling Danish funding and European stability into more reliable output for the war effort.Denmark's approachDenmark is allocating over $50 million to help firms start operations in the country under its \"Build for Ukraine\" initiative.The country's defense ministry described it as a joint Ukrainian-Danish weapons production project, noting it also benefits Denmark. Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen said it will give his country's forces \"easier access to some of the newest technologies and experiences from Ukraine.\"Ukrainian companies, large and small, are making weaponry for the country's fight.Vitalii Nosach/Global Images Ukraine via Getty ImagesThis could be the kind of assistance Ukrainian industry leaders have long called for, arguing that allowing Ukrainian producers to sell weapons to partner nations\u2014 not just to their own government \u2014 lets them scale up and ultimately make more for Ukraine's fight.Ukraine's defense minister, Denys Shmyhal, said in August that the Build for Ukraine plan would also provide more weapons to his own troops, saying it would \"ensure more effective equipping of our warriors with everything they require.\" The joint projects are eligible for EU funding, the defense ministry said.Right now, Ukrainian rules surrounding exports are so stringent that companies and industry bodies working on its defense say that exports are effectively frozen. Denmark's new move could be something of an export opportunity, just via relocation. It opens the possibility for technology, know-how, and intellectual property transfers or collaborative development.That production being on NATO soil provides protection from Russian attacks and aligns with Ukraine's goal of integrating itself more with European militaries and industries. It also reduces security costs, which run high in a country at war.Serhiy Goncharov, CEO of the National Association of Ukrainian Defense Industries (NAUDI), which represents around 100 companies, told Business Insider that his organization wanted Ukrainian companies to be able to work on co-production ventures abroad, and he hopes other European countries will follow in the footsteps of the Danes.Ukraine's government, he said, simply cannot afford to buy \"all of the military production that can be produced in Ukraine,\" and this agreement allows the countries to \"support each other,\" combining Danish resources with Ukrainian expertise to get more equipment for both militaries.So far, only one Ukrainian company is planning to set up new operations in Denmark. Fire Point makes drones, missiles, and other weaponry. In Denmark, it's planning to make rocket fuel. More partnerships are expected, though.Ukrainian-made drones have been a core part of the country's defense, and an area Ukraine wants to make more of.Scott Peterson/Getty ImagesDenmark is eager to learn from Ukrainian companies on tech and swift production models as it and other European countries brace for the possibility of expanded Russian aggression.Poulsen, the defense minister, told BI in February that his country's defense industry has \"a lot to learn from Ukraine.\" He wants collaboration so that Denmark can \"get some of the lessons learned from the defense companies in Ukraine back to Danish defense companies.\"Ukraine's production problemsIt is vital that Ukraine scale up its defense sector and produce more of its own weapons. Throughout the war, Kyiv has faced recurring shortages from Western partners \u2014 either because partners could not afford to send more, didn't have the stockpiles, faced production backlogs, or, in some cases, wavered politically.Relying on its own weaponry allows Ukraine to avoid this problem, as well as the restrictions that partners have at times imposed on the weaponry, making them less useful for Ukraine.However, issues like budget constraints have held it back.Ukraine aims to produce much more of its own weaponry. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said this month that more than 40% of the weapons used on the front line are Ukrainian-made. He wants to see that number increase to 50% by the end of the year.Other efforts are underway to help Ukraine ramp up production, like new movement on the possibility of exports abroad.Being able to produce on foreign soil offers valuable protection that reduces the strain on defense companies that are forced to break apart and disperse operations at home to avoid becoming top targets for a Russian attack.\"We try to be smart about it and not create a big enough target for it to attract too much attention,\" the CEO of Ukrainian autonomous systems developer Ark Robotics told Business Insider. The problem is that these preventive measures slow things down and make it hard to scale. The company, he shared, wants to move as much of its production as possible into other parts of Europe.Denmark was already a leader in supporting Ukraine's arms output. It spearheads the \"Danish Model,\" an initiative to buy weapons directly from Ukrainian manufacturers rather than from other European or US firms. That weaponry reaches Ukraine faster and cheaper, without the backlogs plaguing Western producers.That model increased the production of key Ukrainian weaponry, like the 2S22 Bohdana 155mm howitzer, and it keeps growing. However, it's still in its early stages, unable, by itself, to close the gap that Ukraine is struggling to overcome and prompting Denmark and other partner nations to keep seeking additional solutions, like \"Build for Ukraine,\" that can operate alongside it.Read the original article on Business Insider",

It\u2019s expected to last into Monday, authorizing the state\u2019s emergency services personnel to be activated as necessary.\nParts of the state are forecast to experience moderate to major coastal flooding, inland flash flooding, winds up to 60 mph (97 kph), up to 5 inches (about 13 centimeters) of rain and high surf, potentially causing beach erosion. Some volunteers were putting sandbags at beaches.\nThe National Weather Service placed New York City under a coastal flood warning and wind advisory through at least Monday afternoon. Coastal areas of suburban Long Island could see flooding, with up to 3 inches (about 8 centimeters) of rain and lashing winds expected, the weather service said.\nWind gusts of more than 30 mph (48 kph) were already being recorded in the region on Sunday morning.\nSome flight delays and cancellations were announced in airports from Washington, D.C. to Boston.\nThe storm was expected to move out by Monday night.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "content": "As the Middle East broadly welcomes a\u00a0ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war\u00a0in Gaza, Iran finds itself at one of its weakest moments since its 1979 Islamic Revolution.\nTehran has operated its self-described\u00a0\u201cAxis of Resistance\u201dover several decades, supporting militant groups and nations allied with it against Israel and the United States. But as Israel bombed the Gaza Strip, it also turned its crosshairs toward top leaders abroad in militant groups like Hamas, Lebanon\u2019s Hezbollah and even the top echelon within Iran\u2019s military and nuclear program \u2014 killing many and disrupting their ability to fight back.\nAs\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0prepares for a Middle East trip that likely will see him praised by Israel and Arab nations, Iran won\u2019t be at the table as it still\u00a0struggles to recover from June\u2019s 12-day war.\nHow Tehran\u2019s theocracy responds in the weeks and months ahead, whether that means lashing out or trying to rebuild its hobbled economy at home, will be crucial.\n\u201cUndoubtedly this is a not a proud moment for Iran,\u201d said Ali Vaez, the Iran project director at the International Crisis Group. \u201cIts alliance system in the region is in ruins but it doesn\u2019t mean that the \u2018Axis of Resistance\u2019 is no more.\u201d\n\u2018Like a bankrupt gambler\u2019\nIranian state media has sought to describe the Gaza ceasefire as a victory for Hamas, despite the war destroying the Gaza Strip and killing over 67,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza\u2019s Health Ministry, which doesn\u2019t differentiate between civilians and combatants but says around half the dead are women and children.\nIran\u2019s Foreign Ministry welcomed \u201cany decision \u2026 that guarantees halting the genocide of Palestinians.\u201d Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi reiterated that on Saturday, telling state television that Hamas decided to accept the deal and that Tehran has \u201calways supported any plan, any action that led to the halt of crimes, genocide\u201d by Israel against the people of Gaza.\nBut perhaps more tellingly, an adviser to Iran\u2019s 86-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei suggested the ceasefire would only lead to conflict elsewhere in the region.\n\u201cThe start of the ceasefire in Gaza may be the behind-the-scenes end of the ceasefire somewhere else!\u201d Ali Akbar Velayati, an adviser to Khamenei, wrote on X, referencing Hezbollah, Yemen\u2019s Iranian-backed Houthi rebels and Iraq.\nThe fear of further Israeli strikes, particularly on Iran, remains acute in the public\u2019s mind as much of Iranian\u00a0air defenses likely were destroyed by Israel in June. Khamenei has not resumed his usual routine of weekly speeches to audiences. Without explanation, Iran avoided holding a major military commemoration marking the end of the Iran-Iraq war in September, which typically sees top officials watch drones and missile launchers parade past them.\nIran\u2019s\u00a0economy also has suffered under international sanctions and as global energy prices fall.\n\u201cIran has always focused on its interests, we do not have resources anymore, our economy has weakened,\u201d said Tehran-based analyst Saeed Leilaz. \u201cOur support to Hamas was a reaction to U.S. to divert conflicts from our borders.\u201d\nOthers are less optimistic.\n\u201cIran is like a bankrupt gambler after winning some small money in the first rounds,\u201d said Amir Kazemi, a university student in Tehran. \u201cWhen Hamas attacked Israel, Iran was happy about it. But now, after the ceasefire, Iran finds nothing in its pocket.\u201d\nMideast looks far different\nIn the immediate years after\u00a0Iran\u2019s revolution, its theocratic government sought to export its Shiite revolutionary ideology more widely in the Middle East. That morphed following its devastating 1980s war with Iraq into more of an effort to provide a level of deterrence as Arab nations around it purchased sophisticated American bombs, warplanes and tanks that Tehran couldn\u2019t access due to sanctions.\nThe U.S. military\u2019s presence across the Persian Gulf also expanded following\u00a0the 1991 Gulf War, with Arab nations granting basing rights to American forces to Tehran\u2019s constant anger.\nThe peak of the \u201cAxis of Resistance\u201d came in the chaotic years after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion of Iraq and Yemen\u2019s subsequent collapse into a civil war. Then, it could count on Hezbollah, Syrian autocrat Bashar Assad, the Houthis, Iraqi militant groups and even Hamas \u2014 a Sunni militant group.\nToday, the Mideast looks far different.\nIn Syria,\u00a0rebels overthrew Assad last year,\u00a0Israeli strikes killed Hezbollah and Hamas\u2019 top leaders, while Iraqi militant groups faded into the background. Yemen\u2019s Houthis, while still capable of launching attacks on Israel and\u00a0commercial shipping in the Red Sea corridor, find themselves now targeted by increasingly precise Israeli strikes.\nAnd the 12-day war in June left Iran likely no longer enriching uranium for its nuclear program, which\u00a0the West long has worried could be weaponized.\n\u2018Collapsing regional clout\u2019\nIran, meanwhile, has yet to receive any major support from either China or Russia, despite providing Beijing with likely discounted oil and Moscow with the drones it uses in its war on Ukraine. Tehran has also shied away from confronting\u00a0women who are increasingly abandoning the hijab, or headscarf, instead executing prisoners it already holds\u00a0at a rate unseen in decades.\n\u201cThe ceasefire is reflective of Tehran\u2019s collapsing regional clout following the unraveling of its long-powerful \u2018Axis of Resistance\u2019 since 2024,\u201d said Ali Fathollah-Nejad, the director of the Berlin-based Center for Middle East and Global Order. \u201cThe ceasefire will free Israeli military capacities that would now be used against Iranian interests \u2014 whether in Lebanon against Hezbollah or directly against Iran.\u201d\nFor his part, Trump seized on Iran accepting the ceasefire as \u201cterrific\u201d news. However, there\u2019s been no move toward renewed public negotiations with Tehran over its nuclear program.\n\u201cTime is not on Iran\u2019s side but their problem is no one is really giving them an exit ramp,\u201d Vaez said. But whether Tehran would take the ramp also remains in question as its leaders still debate what turn to now take.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "description": "The risk is \"that we move from going broke slowly to going broke quickly,\" Kelly says.",
      "content": "JPMorgan\u2019s David Kelly warned this week that while America is \u201cgoing broke,\u201d it\u2019s doing so slowly enough that markets aren\u2019t panicking yet. With U.S. national debt now topping $37.8 trillion and interest payments exceeding $1.2 trillion, Kelly said the debt-to-GDP ratio\u2014already at 99.9%\u2014will likely keep rising even under moderate growth. Despite tariff revenues and temporary deficit relief, he cautioned that political choices or a slowdown could quickly worsen the fiscal picture, urging investors to diversify away from U.S. assets before \u201cgoing broke slowly\u201d turns fast.\n\nAmerica is going broke, JPMorgan Asset Management\u2019s chief global strategist David Kelly wrote in a note this week, but no one is panicking yet because the government is going broke slowly.\nKelly outlined the while the economy is facing a barrage of issues (geopolitics, trade wars, changing immigration enforcement, and government shutdowns to name a few) one of the key longer-term issues is how the U.S. government is going to pay its bills. \nIn a bid to wrangle down U.S. federal debt\u2014and its contributions to the wider national debt\u2014President Trump initially asked Tesla CEO Elon Musk to form the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) with the goal of axing $2 trillion from the federal budget.\nBut the pair then famously fell out over the White House\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill act, which the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated will add another $3.4 trillion to the national debt over the next decade. The White House countered its tariff regime will offset the spending and any decrease in revenues due to tax cuts. The CBO estimates that tariffs should reduce total deficits by $4 trillion by 2035.\nAmerica\u2019s national debt is spiraling higher by the second. At the time of writing it sits at over $37.8 trillion, and there are $1.2 trillion in interest payments to service the borrowing. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Fed chairman Jerome Powell have both expressed concerns about it.\nKelly\u2019s point is that while investors are mindful of the basic maths, the problem is going to unfold over a long period of time.\n\u201cThe question I am asked most frequently by investors and financial advisors is when is the federal debt going to blow up in all of our faces. My usual answer is that, while we\u00a0are\u00a0going broke, we are going broke\u00a0slowly. Global bond markets are very well aware of the trajectory of U.S. debt. The fact that even today, the U.S. government can borrow money for 30 years at a yield of just 4.6% speaks to a conviction that there remains room for the government to borrow more,\u201d Kelly wrote in a note yesterday. \nOptimism or naivety \nThe economist wrote that in the near term casual speculators may have some reason for optimism. For example, he pointed to tariff revenues raking in significant sums ($31 billion in August according to the White House) and recent estimates from the CBO and the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget that deficits for FY2025 will total 6% of GDP, down from 6.3% last year.\nThis reduction of borrowing as a percentage of economic growth is a key factor watched by America\u2019s lenders. A nation\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio is a clear barometer of whether a nation will be able to repay its debts or pay higher interest rates to sell its borrowing.\nBut Kelly cautioned: \u201cIt\u2019s worth pausing here to consider this number. The total federal debt in the hands of the public is now almost $30.3 trillion or, we estimate, 99.9% of GDP. Starting from these levels, if nominal GDP grows by roughly 4.5% going forward, (comprised of 2.0% real growth and 2.5% inflation), then any budget deficit north of 4.5% will cause the debt-to-GDP ratio to rise. Under our assumptions, the debt-to-GDP ratio climbs from 99.9% on September 30th, 2025 to 102.2% of GDP 12 months later.\u201d \nDebt is likely to rise even quicker than this, he added.\nOn tariffs, for example, there are still questions about the legalities of Trump\u2019s action. If they are overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court, \u201cThis would, at a minimum, force the administration to go back to the drawing board to impose replacement tariffs under some other authority or by sending a bill through Congress. Moreover, it could force substantial refunds of tariffs already paid in recent months,\u201d Kelly added.\nMoreover, these estimates are reliant on \u201cno recession and no need for other major spending on domestic or international priorities.\u201d Questions about whether the U.S. may already technically be in a recession in some states are growing. Kelly adds: \u201cBecause of all of this, a deficit equal to 6.7% of GDP should probably be regarded as a low-ball estimate of this year\u2019s red ink.\u201d\nThe takeaway for investors is diversifying their portfolios in case America\u2019s debt begins to spiral more quickly than the current environment, Kelly said: \u201cThere is a danger that political choices lead to a faster deterioration in the federal finances, leading to a backup in long-term interest rates and a lower dollar. Based on current allocations and valuations alone, many investors should likely consider diversifying their portfolios by adding alternative assets and international stocks. The risk that we move from going broke slowly to going broke quickly adds an important reason to make this move today.\u201d\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "description": "\u201cWe\u2019re barreling toward one of the longest shutdowns in American history,\u201d Johnson said, standing alone at the Capitol on the 13th day of the shutdown.",
      "content": "Republican\u00a0Speaker Mike Johnson\u00a0predicted Monday the federal\u00a0government shutdown\u00a0may become the longest in history, saying he \u201cwon\u2019t negotiate\u201d with Democrats until they hit pause on their\u00a0health care demands\u00a0and reopen.\nStanding alone at the Capitol on the 13th day of the shutdown, the speaker said he was unaware of the details of the\u00a0thousands of federal workers\u00a0being fired by the Trump administration. It\u2019s a highly unusual mass layoff widely seen as way to seize on the shutdown to\u00a0reduce the scope\u00a0of government. Vice\u00a0President JD Vance\u00a0has warned of\u00a0\u201cpainful\u201d cuts\u00a0ahead, even as employee unions sue.\n\u201cWe\u2019re barreling toward one of the longest shutdowns in American history,\u201d Johnson of Louisiana said.\nWith no endgame in sight, the shutdown is expected to roll on for the unforeseeable future. The closure has halted routine\u00a0government operations, shuttered Smithsonian museums and other landmark\u00a0cultural institutions\u00a0and left airports scrambling with\u00a0flight disruptions, all injecting more uncertainty into an already\u00a0precarious economy.\nThe House is\u00a0out of legislative session, with Johnson refusing to recall lawmakers back to Washington, while the Senate, closed Monday for the federal holiday, will return to work Tuesday. But senators are stuck in a cul-de-sac of failed votes as Democrats refuse to relent on their health care demands.\nJohnson thanked President Donald Trump for ensuring\u00a0military personnel are paid\u00a0this week, which removed one main\u00a0pressure point\u00a0that may have pushed the parties to the negotiating table.\nAt its core, the shutdown is a debate over health care policy \u2014 and particularly the\u00a0Affordable Care Act subsidies\u00a0that are expiring for millions of Americans who rely on government aid to purchase their own health insurance policies on the Obamacare exchanges. Democrats demand the subsidies be extended, Republicans argue the issue can be dealt with later.\nWith Congress and the White House stalemated, some are eyeing the end of the month as the next potential deadline to reopen government.\nThat\u2019s when open enrollment begins, Nov. 1, for the health program at issue, and Americans will face the prospect of skyrocketing insurance premiums. The Kaiser Family Foundation has estimated that monthly costs would double if Congress fails to renew the subsidy payments that expire Dec. 31.\nIt\u2019s also when government workers on monthly pay schedules, including thousands of House aides, will go without paychecks.\nThe health care debate has dogged Congress ever since the Affordable Care Act became law under then-President Barak Obama in 2010.\nThe country went through a 16-day government shutdown during the Obama presidency when Republicans tried to repeal the Affordable Care Act 2013.\nTrump tried to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the law, commonly known as Obamacare, during his first term, in 2017, with a Republican majority in the House and Senate. That effort failed when then-Sen. John McCain memorably voted a thumbs down on the plan.\nWith 24 million now enrolled in Obamacare, a record, Johnson said Monday that Republicans are unlikely to go that route again, noting he still has \u201cPTSD\u201d from that botched moment.\n\u201cCan we completely repeal and replace Obamacare? Many of us are skeptical about that now because the roots are so deep,\u201d Johnson said.\nThe Republican speaker insists his party has been willing to discuss the health care issue with Democrats this fall, before the subsidies expire at the end of the year. But first, he said, Democrats have to agree to reopen the government.\nThe longest shutdown, during Trump\u2019s first term over his demands for funds to build the U.S.-Mexico border wall,\u00a0ended in 2019\u00a0after 35 days.\nMeanwhile, the Trump administration is exercising vast leeway both to fire workers \u2014 drawing complaints from fellow Republicans and lawsuits from employee unions \u2014 and to determine who is paid.\nThat means not only military troops but other Trump administration priorities don\u2019t necessarily have to go without pay, thanks to the various other funding sources as well as the billions made available in what\u2019s commonly called Trump\u2019s\u00a0One Big Beautiful Bill Act\u00a0that\u2019s now law.\nThe Pentagon said over the weekend it was able to tap\u00a0$8 billion\u00a0in unused research and development funds to pay the military personnel. They had risked missed paychecks on Wednesday. But the\u00a0Education Department\u00a0is among those being hard hit, disrupting special education, after-school programs and others.\n\u201cThe Administration also could decide to use mandatory funding provided in the 2025 reconciliation act or other sources of mandatory funding to continue activities financed by those direct appropriations at various agencies,\u201d according to the\u00a0nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\nThe CBO had cited the Department of Defense, the Department of the Treasury, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Office of Management and Budget as among those that received specific funds under the law.\n\u201cSome of the funds in DoD\u2019s direct appropriation under the 2025 reconciliation act could be used to pay active-duty personnel during a shutdown, thus reducing the number of excepted workers who would receive delayed compensation,\u201d CBO wrote in a letter responding to questions raised by Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

The powerful cannons are far more than an annoyance. They have injured personnel and damaged equipment. Ramming is also common.There have been boarding incidents that the Philippines have characterized as piracy. Chinese personnel in those incidents even carried bladed weapons. China has also employed dazzlers and acoustic devices in confrontations.The majority of engagements are gray zone aggression below the threshold of war, but these still carry risks.Maneuvers like ramming, blocking, and chasing run a risk of causing a major accident that could, intentional or otherwise, prove fatal. A recent incident came at the expense of China's own ships.TKCourtesy of Jay Tarriela, Philippine Coast Guard SpokespersonIn August, while a Chinese destroyer and a Chinese coast guard vessel were chasing a Philippine patrol boat at high speeds east of the Scarborough Shoal, the destroyer crossed into the path of the coast guard vessel, resulting in a catastrophic collision. Video footage from the incident showed significant damage to the hull of the coast guard ship.Regarding this Sunday's clash, China blamed the Philippines for entering waters that it claims without permission and said a Philippine vessel dangerously approached a Chinese coast guard ship, causing a scrape. China continues to exert its territorial claims over the majority of the South China Sea, which have been called repeatedly into question.China has also had run-ins and confrontations with other militaries in the South China Sea, both at sea and in the air. China routinely dismisses complaints, arguing its actions are lawful and necessary to protect its sovereignty.Read the original article on Business Insider",

This has afforded Moscow more weapons for hunting down trains.Russia has been carrying out attacks against Ukraine's rail network since the early days of the war. However, it began increasing the frequency of strikes in early August, focusing on \"disrupting critical connections,\" Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's prime minister, said earlier this month.Since August, Russia has launched nearly 300 strikes on the Ukrainian railway system, said Oleksii Kuleba, Ukraine's deputy prime minister for restoration, on Sunday in his latest tally of attacks. Officials have said that targets include trains, stations, and other infrastructure.Since the start of the war, 221 railway workers have been wounded and 37 have died while performing their duties by Russian strikes. They have also caused civilian casualties. With the increase in attacks, those numbers could spike. An October 4 strike on a train station left one person dead and 30 more injured.The representative of Ukrzaliznytsia, Ukraine's state-owned railway company, said their understanding is that Moscow's goals are to sow panic among passengers and to disrupt the economy. The recent uptick in attacks has been linked to a rise in Russian drone production, they said.The aftermath of a Russian attack on a Ukrainian train earlier this month.Pavlo Zarva/Kordon.Media/Global Images Ukraine via Getty Images\"Previously, they simply did not have sufficient resources for a single combat drone, such as a Shahed, to hunt down a locomotive,\" the railway representative told Business Insider. \"Now they can afford to use Shaheds to hit individual locomotives rather than strategic targets.\"Neither Russia's embassy in the US nor its defense ministry immediately responded to a request for comment from Business Insider on the strike campaign.Russia has significantly scaled up its drone operations this year. The country now produces around 4,000 a month at its factories, and it has been able to attack Ukraine with hundreds of them in its nightly strikes. Western intelligence has warned this could eventually become thousands.Russia has also notably expanded its drone bases and launch sites in recent months in a sign that it is investing heavily in cheap long-range strike capabilities.In an October 4 social media post, Svyrydenko said that Moscow also uses missiles to \"systematically\" attack Ukraine's rail network. \"Alongside their strikes on energy facilities ahead of the winter season, Russia now seeks to sever the very arteries of life in Ukraine \u2014 the routes that carry people, enable medical evacuation, and deliver hope across our country,\" she said.Kuleba said in a statement on the Telegram messaging platform that Ukrzaliznytsia tends to restore infrastructure within just a few hours of attacks and usually gets operations going again later that day.Russia's new campaign against Ukraine's rail network comes as part of the broader expansion of its drone attacks against the country. Over the past several months, it has regularly targeted cities and civilian infrastructure with hundreds of armed and decoy drones, the latter of which are designed to exhaust Kyiv's already strained air defenses.Ukraine, meanwhile, has ramped up its own strike campaign since early August, using long-range drones in attacks on Russian energy infrastructure, including oil refineries. The goal has been to disrupt a key source of revenue that fuels Moscow's war efforts and apply pressure on the Kremlin.Read the original article on Business Insider",

      "description": "Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said around 10% of the controller workforce is engaging in \"sickouts\" and threatened to fire these \u201cproblem children.\u201d",
      "content": "Airports across the United States have been experiencing significant flight delays recently because of a shortage of air traffic controllers, who have been required to work without pay since a government shutdown began on Oct. 1, 2025. Reports suggest employees have been calling in sick in increased numbers. And since there was already a shortage of controllers before the shutdown, the impact has been severe, with thousands of flights delayed or canceled since the shutdown began.\nThe Conversation U.S. asked Brian Strzempkowski and Melanie Dickman, aviation experts at The Ohio State University, to explain how the shutdown is affecting air travel, what that means for passengers and air safety, as well as the air traffic controller shortage that has been plaguing U.S. airports for years.\nHow is the shutdown affecting air traffic controllers?\nAir traffic controllers are deemed essential workers, meaning they are still required to work while not receiving compensation \u2013 which they would typically then receive in a lump sum after the shutdown ends. President Donald Trump created some uncertainty around this by suggesting workers may not get their back pay without explicit authorization from Congress, despite having signed a law in his first term that makes it a legal requirement.\nWorking without regular pay, combined with the possibility that they won\u2019t get paid at all, is resulting in real financial stress for air traffic controllers, who perform one of the most stressful jobs there is.\nAs a result, there have been reports of air traffic controllers calling in sick in large numbers. This happened in previous shutdowns as well. During the 2018-2019 shutdown, for example, sickouts started to happen around the two-week mark, roughly when the first paycheck was missed. Controllers, airport security employees, and other essential workers were calling in sick often so they could work another part-time job to pay their bills.\nIn the current shutdown, this appears to be happening sooner, less than a week after it began. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said around 10% of the controller workforce is engaging in this practice and threatened to fire these \u201cproblem children.\u201d\nWhat does this mean for people about to take a flight?\nBefore the shutdown, there was already a critical shortage of air traffic controllers. Coupled with workers calling in sick in recent days, this has led to severe travel delays at many major airports, such as those in Atlanta and Denver, and regional ones, like those serving Burbank, California, and Daytona Beach, Florida.\nA big question on travelers\u2019 minds is whether this will affect air safety.\nThe air traffic control system is multi-layered and has redundancies built into it to ensure an incredibly safe environment. While controller shortages do begin to erode some of those redundancies, contingency plans are in place to help protect the system. For example, air traffic can be diverted away from affected locations or delayed, or the flight may even be be canceled before the plane leaves the gate.\nAs an example, Newark Liberty International Airport can accommodate approximately 80 aircraft departing or arriving per hour when the airport and airspace is fully operational. However, due to technical failures, staffing shortages and construction at the airport, capacity was limited to between 28 and 34 aircraft per hour in June 2025. Due to technology upgrades and procedural changes, that number was recently increased to between 68 and 72 aircraft per hour. By regulating the amount of traffic, the system can be protected to ensure the safety of every aircraft.\nThis was an example of high-level oversight in which the secretary of transportation was personally involved in seeking a solution to ensure air travel remained safe while trying to increase capacity.\nHow does the U.S. keep air travel safe?\nOn a more day-to-day level, the Federal Aviation Administration relies on the Air Traffic Control System Command Center, located about 40 miles away from Washington, D.C. This facility oversees the entire national airspace system and essentially \u201ccontrols\u201d the controllers. Air traffic professionals monitor staffing at air traffic facilities, weather conditions, equipment failures and unexpected disruptions to the system.\nWhen an incident arises, such as Burbank Airport recently reporting that no controllers were available, the command center issues an alert stating that any aircraft inbound to Burbank must divert to an alternate airport, and any aircraft that has not yet taken off will be held on the ground.\nStaffing shortages at other air traffic control facilities may require alternate plans, such as transitioning workloads from one facility with fewer controllers, to another that is appropriately staffed. There is a wide range of tools that the Air Traffic Control System Command Center can utilize to protect the system, but it all stems from the idea of managing the capacity. Flight delays and cancellations, while disruptive to individual travelers, are actually good from a system perspective, because they prevent congestion in the airspace.\nWhy was there an air traffic controller shortage in the first place?\nThere has been a systemic problem with hiring of air traffic controllers for more than a decade.\nOver the years, the FAA has fallen behind on training enough controllers to replace those who retire each year. In May 2025, we wrote about the FAA\u2019s plan to utilize colleges across the country to provide the professional training for this career field. While it will take a little time for the students to matriculate through college and into the workforce, this plan will be a significant contributor to solving the controller shortage problem.\nMeanwhile, the FAA Academy, which trains U.S. air traffic controllers, only has limited funding from the previous federal budget for current students. The shutdown means no new students can begin training. Depending on the length of the shutdown, the funding may run out as additional employees are furloughed. The ripple effects of a shutdown can remain for many months after the government reopens.\nWhat\u2019s the government doing to end the shortage?\nIn July, Congress authorized over US$12 billion in funding to help modernize the air traffic control system.\nSecretary Duffy is currently leading an effort to identify a contractor to implement the technology upgrades needed to modernize the system and make it more robust. Duffy has said an additional $19 billion investment will be needed to complete the task.\nBrian Strzempkowski, Assistant Director, Center for Aviation Studies, The Ohio State University and Melanie Dickman, Lecturer in Aviation Studies, The Ohio State University\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.
