      "source": "Fortune",
      "description": "Powell gave two strong signals that liquidity will soon be injected into the market.",
      "content": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell is not known for giving decisive hints. Still, on Tuesday he did something rare: he openly acknowledged the rising \u201cdownside risks to unemployment\u201d in a clearly dovish signal that the central bank is preparing to ease monetary policy.\u00a0\nPowell\u2019s speech, delivered at an event for the National Association for Business Economics (NABE), was nominally about the Fed\u2019s balance sheet. However, it concluded with a carefully placed shift in tone: the labor market is weakening faster than previously thought, inflation is no longer the sole threat, and policy may finally need to \u201ctake another step toward a more neutral stance.\u201d\nOn Wall Street, there was little debate about what that meant\u2014investors online rejoiced that \u201cPowell is Dovish!\u201d\nAnother crypto page on X exclaimed that the stage is set \u201cfor a parabolic Q4.\u201d\u00a0\nPowell\u2019s comments caused a kick-up in the Dow Tuesday afternoon, climbing nearly 400 points after having fallen 600 throughout the day due to trade tensions.\u00a0\n\u201cPowell signals end of balance sheet rolloff\u2014QT\u2014in September and affirms market expectations for more rate cuts in October and December,\u201d economist Diane Swonk wrote on X shortly after the speech, meaning that the rate-cut cycle is approaching. Investors expect with near certainty that the Fed will cut rates by 25 bps during October\u2019s meeting, according to the CME FedWatch tool.The KPMG chief economist noted that, in \u201cclassic Powell humility,\u201d he acknowledged the Federal Reserve had been slow to halt monetary expansion in 2021 after several rounds of post-pandemic stimulus fueled inflation.\nA shift driven by labor market risk\nIndeed, the Fed has spent more than two years fighting sticky inflation with the most aggressive tightening cycle since the 1980s. In a moment of rare institutional self-reflection, Powell conceded that the Fed kept its balance sheet expansion going too long during the pandemic.\n\u201cWith the clarity of hindsight, we could have\u2014and perhaps should have\u2014stopped asset purchases sooner,\u201d he said.\u00a0\nThat acknowledgement shows Powell is keenly aware of the cost of acting too slowly\u2014and may now be erring on the side of avoiding a recession rather than crushing the last 0.9 percentage points of inflation to get the inflation rate down to the Fed\u2019s target of 2%.\u00a0\nPowell noted that the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure\u2014core PCE\u2014is running at 2.9%, but said much of the recent bump in goods prices reflected tariffs as opposed to intrinsic inflationary pressure. That line was not accidental. It distances price pressures from monetary policy and gives the Fed cover to cut rates without appearing to surrender on inflation.\nFor a Fed Chair who prefers restraint, this was messaging with intent. The fight against inflation isn\u2019t over, but the Fed just acknowledged a new reality: jobs now matter as much as prices, and policy has to catch up.\nJobs present more of a risk now\nBut Powell acknowledged Tuesday that the central bank\u2019s dual mandate\u2014stable prices and maximum employment\u2014has suddenly started pulling in the other direction.\n\u201cIn this less dynamic and somewhat softer labor market, the downside risks to employment appear to have risen,\u201d Powell said.\nPayroll growth has slowed sharply, participation has dipped, and both business and household surveys show declining confidence in job availability, he added. Those are prime economic conditions to set up policy easing.\u00a0\u00a0\nBalance sheet runoff ending\nPowell added another doveish signal: an end to the Fed\u2019s balance-sheet runoff, or quantitative tightening (QT), as soon as September. The Fed has been shrinking its portfolio of Treasurys and mortgage-backed securities at a pace of up to $95 billion per month in an effort to drain excess liquidity from the financial system.\nBut Powell warned reserves are now \u201cgradually tightening,\u201d and he emphasized the need to avoid a repeat of the 2019 funding squeeze, when interbank lending markets buckled. To avoid a repeat, he told the market exactly what it wanted to hear: QT is almost over, and soon more liquidity will be injected into the market.\n\u201cWe will set policy based on the evolution of the economic outlook and the balance of risks, rather than following a predetermined path,\u201d Powell told investors.\u00a0\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "source": "Fortune",
      "description": "IMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said \u201cthe tariff shock is here, and it is further dimming already weak growth prospects.\"",
      "content": "The U.S. and global economies will grow a bit more this year than previously forecast as the Trump administration\u2019s tariffs have so far proved less disruptive than expected, the International Monetary Fund said Tuesday, though the agency also said the extensive duties still pose risks.\nThe United States\u2019\u00a0economy\u00a0will expand 2% in 2025, the IMF projected in its influential semiannual forecast, the World Economic Outlook. That is slightly higher than the 1.9% forecast in the IMF\u2019s\u00a0last update in July\u00a0and\u00a01.8% in April. The U.S. should grow 2.1% next year, also just one-tenth of a percent faster than its previous projection, the IMF said.\nIts current forecasts are still down from a year ago, however, a sign that the international lending agency expects the tariffs to weaken the U.S. economy, in part by creating more uncertainty for businesses. Last October, the IMF forecast the U.S. would grow 2.2% this year.\nAll the projections also represent a slowing from 2024, when the U.S. economy expanded at a faster 2.8%.\nThe global economy, meanwhile, will grow 3.2% this year, up from a 3% estimate in July, the IMF forecast, and 3.1% in 2026, the same as its previous estimate.\nWhile the U.S. and world economies have fared better than expected, it\u2019s too soon to say they are fully in the clear, the IMF said, as Trump has continued to make tariff threats and it can take time for changes in international trade patterns to play out.\nOn Friday, for example, Trump threatened to\u00a0slap 100% duties\u00a0on all imports from China, which caused a sharp fall in the stock market.\nIMF chief economist Pierre-Olivier Gourinchas said at a news conference that the import taxes and\u00a0ongoing threats to impose more duties\u00a0have created ongoing uncertainty for many businesses and are weighing on the world economy.\n\u201cThe tariff shock is here, and it is further dimming already weak growth prospects,\u201d he said.\nGourinchas also said that a burst of investment in artificial intelligence, in the form of huge data centers and extensive computing power, has helped offset the drag from trade and boosting the U.S. economy. Yet if a financial market bubble formed and then burst, it could sharply slow business investment and consumer spending, he said.\n\u201cThere are echoes in the current tech investment surge of the dot-com boom of the late 1990s,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was the internet then, it is AI now.\u201d\nShares of two companies active in the AI sector, AMD and Oracle, which announced\u00a0an expanding partnership Tuesday, have seen their shares rise 80% this year.\nGains in AI-related stock values have lifted Americans\u2019 wealth and fueled consumer spending, Gourinchas said, just as companies are ramping up their investments in advanced computer chips and building data centers. Hotter spending and investment could push central banks to raise interest rates over time, he said.\nGourinchas also offered several reasons the U.S. and global economies have remained resilient after the widespread imposition of tariffs earlier this year.\n\u201cFirst and foremost, the tariff shock itself is smaller than initially feared, with many trade deals and exemptions,\u201d he said. \u201cMost countries also refrained from retaliation, keeping the trading system open. And the private sector also proved agile, front-loading imports and rerouting supply chains.\u201d\nBy front-loading imports, many U.S. companies were able to stock up on goods before the duties took effect, enabling them to avoid or delay price increases.\nYet many of those factors only reflect \u201ctemporary relief, rather than underlying strength in economic fundamentals,\u201d the IMF\u2019s report said.\nThe IMF also said that import price data in the U.S. shows that so far importers and retailers are paying most of the tariffs, not overseas companies, as many Trump administration officials have predicted. Over time, those firms are likely to pass on more of the price hikes to consumers, the report said.\nThere are signs that some downsides of the higher tariffs are starting to emerge, the IMF outlook said. Core inflation, which excludes the volatile food and energy categories, has ticked up to 2.9%, according to the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred measure, up from 2.7% a year ago. Hiring has ground to nearly a halt, which could partly reflect a more cautious approach by many firms in the wake of the uncertainty created by the higher tariffs.\nThe IMF\u2019s forecasts are modestly more optimistic than many private-sector economists\u2019 expectations. The National Association for Business Economics, a group of academic and business economists, on Monday forecast that the U.S. would grow just 1.8% this year and 1.7% in 2026.\nNearly two-thirds of the economists surveyed by the NABE said they think the administration\u2019s duties are nevertheless slowing growth, by up to a half-percentage point.\nChina, meanwhile, has weathered the hit from U.S. tariffs by sending more of its goods to Europe and Asia, rather than the United States, the IMF said. Its currency has depreciated, which has made its exports cheaper. The IMF is forecasting that China\u2019s economy will expand 4.8% this year and 4.2% in 2026, the same as in July.\nGourinchas said that China\u2019s economy has grown increasingly dependent on exports, while its real estate sector continues to struggle under heavy debt loads.\n\u201cIt is increasingly hard to see how this could be sustained,\u201d he added.\nIn Europe, Germany is bolstering growth by increasing government spending to build up its military, Gourinchas said. The IMF now expects the 20 countries that use the euro to grow 1.2% this year, up from a 1% forecast in July, and 1.1% next year, the same as three months ago.\nThe IMF is a 191-nation lending organization that works to promote economic growth and financial stability and to reduce global poverty.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "content": "Ukrainian helicopters have become an increasingly important air defense tool.ZUMA Press Wire via Reuters ConnectUkraine will form new helicopter units to shoot down Russian drones, Zelenskyy announced this week.Helicopters have become a vital part of Ukraine's air defense amid a worsening Russian drone threat.Kyiv's top general said they can sometimes shoot down as many as 40% of the drones in their area.Ukraine will form new helicopter units to shoot down exploding Russian drones, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced this week, as Kyiv looks to aircraft for support in defending the skies.\"We determined how to expand the capabilities of army aviation to protect against drones,\" Zelenskyy said after meeting with military officials on Monday. \"Additional helicopter groups will be formed.\"In a statement published on the Telegram messaging platform, he said Ukraine is working with its international partners to secure \"more necessary types of aircraft.\" He did not provide additional details about how many new helicopter groups would be formed.Helicopters have become an essential part of Ukraine's air defenses as Russia has ramped up the production of its notorious one-way attack drones, strikes exacting a worsening toll on cities and civilian infrastructure.Ukraine's military commander-in-chief, Oleksandr Syrskyi, said last month that helicopters can sometimes shoot down as many as 40% of the Russian drones in their coverage areas, depending on the weather.Syrskyi told reporters that Ukraine is \"scaling up this direction\" and needs its helicopters to be equipped with technology that allows them to spot threats around the clock and in all weather conditions.Ukraine's top general also described plans at the time to develop light-engine aircraft with machine guns to intercept Russian drones.Ukraine announced plans this week to form new helicopter units.ZUMA Press Wire via Reuters ConnectRussia regularly alters its Shahed routes to stymie Ukrainian defenses. Helicopters can more rapidly respond to radar-detected drone threats than truck-mounted gun crews.Russia has invested heavily in its drone operations over the past year. It now produces around 4,000 drones a month at its factories, and regularly attacks Ukraine with hundreds of them in a single night. Western intelligence has warned that this could eventually increase to thousands.Russia has also expanded its drone bases and launch sites in recent months, further underscoring how the country intends to rely on cheap weapons to bombard Ukraine at long range.These developments, and worsening attacks, have pushed Ukraine to seek out cost-efficient air defenses that match the cheap drone threat without being forced to rely on solely on very expensive guided missiles fired from ground launchers and fighter jets.Helicopters, like the Soviet-era Mil Mi-24 gunship, have emerged as one solution at Ukraine's disposal; the military has published several videos this year showing fixed-wing aircraft shooting down Russian drones. Crew members have filmed the use of Gatling guns and door-mounted machine guns.But Kyiv has also identified another promising solution: interceptor drones, which can hunt and kill Russian drones mid-flight. Ukraine's defense industry has ramped up production of these systems, which are intended to cost roughly the same as their targets \u2014 Russian drones are estimated to be worth tens of thousands of dollars \u2014\u00a0and be deployable at scale.Zelenskyy, in his Telegram statement on Monday, said \"maximum production volumes\" of interceptor drones are needed.Read the original article on Business Insider",

      "source": "Business Insider",
      "description": "Many Americans feel that moving is too expensive or difficult. Some are turning to ADUs as a way to add more space without physically relocating.",
      "content": "The front of the Benjamin's ADU.Courtesy of VillaI've interviewed many people who've built tiny homes, or accessory dwelling units, on their property.For many, ADUs are a way to add more space without having to move. ADUs are becoming a go-to for homeowners up against higher home prices, mortgage rates, and taxes.My husband and I are in our second year of marriage and are finally starting to think seriously about homeownership.Between scanning Zillow, reading housing studies, and even scrolling through social media, one thing is clear: buying a new home has never felt so out of reach, even for two working people with decent salaries.For my job as a real estate reporter, I've interviewed numerous people who built tiny homes or accessory dwelling units (ADUs). Many of them did so because moving to a new or bigger home wasn't an option for them or their loved ones, so they resorted to a workaround that, while not cheap, is less expensive than a typical house.Todd Kuchta, an engineer from Northern California, spent $248,000 building a tiny home for his adult son, who has special needs \u2014 a bargain given that typical homes in the area sell for over $1 million. Justin Mauldin, the CEO of an Austin-based PR agency, added a backyard office to free up space in the main house. The total price tag? $41,500 \u2014 much less than upsizing to a new home in the Texas capital.Sure, building an ADU is not an option for my husband and me just yet. But hearing how people have turned to them as an alternative to moving \u2014 as ways to house a relative and add square footage without a full-on renovation \u2014 is inspiring.Tiny homes and ADUs are becoming more popularADUs are small backyard homes that typically range from 150 to 1,200 square feet, depending on local regulations. The average cost to build an ADU falls between $100,000 and $300,000, not including permitting fees. Some states, including California, Colorado, New York, and Vermont, offer grants to help homeowners offset these costs.Sheri Koones, an author and expert on tiny homes, ADUs, and home construction, told me that the nation's severe shortage of homes for sale is driving the popularity of tiny homes and ADUs.\"It is a particularly difficult market for young people and baby boomers trying to find housing,\" Koones said. \"Multigenerational housing situations are becoming more common. Parents will have adult children live in the ADU on their property, and when the 'children' have their own children, they swap housing with each other.\"The exterior of Kuchta's ADU.Villa/Nicholas MillerA 2024 study from the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco estimates that there are now at least 1.6 million ADUs in the US. The Fed indicates that the number of single-family homes with an ADU is nearly one-third the number of owner-occupied condos nationwide. Of all states, California has the most, with at least 201,000, followed by Washington, with over 77,800.California resident Selma Hepp, chief economist at Cotality, formerly known as CoreLogic, and an ADU owner herself, told me that as long as soaring home prices and mortgage rates keep housing affordability at an all-time low, ADUs will continue gaining traction.\"When you look at the markets that are least affordable, in the future, you may see people thinking of alternative ways to maximize their land use,\" Hepp said. \"Potentially down the road, you'll see them in more areas.\"ADUs are a solution for homeowners wanting more spaceLast fall, I spoke with Kuchta, 58, about building a tiny home in his backyard for his son, Jacob.Jacob, who is in his mid-20s, wanted more independence and a place of his own. But because he has autism, he still relies on his parents for help with daily tasks like cleaning, taking medication, and preparing meals.With his monthly medical support costs exceeding $9,000, buying a larger home or moving to an assisted living facility was out of the question.I completely understand why. The Kuchtas live in Napa County \u2014 one of the most expensive real estate markets in the country. The region is dotted with multimillion-dollar estates and wineries. As of February, the median home sale price was $1.1 million, according to Redfin.Rather than purchasing a new property, the Kuchtas are making the most of what they already have. To build a 480-square-foot tiny home on their 6,000-square-foot lot, they took out a second mortgage on their home, valued at over $800,000. That gave them $160,000 to work with. They also received a $63,000 forgivable loan from Napa County's Affordable ADU program.Todd Kuchta (center) with his wife and son, standing outside their ADU.Villa/Nicholas MillerJacob's new place \u2014 a one-bedroom unit with a full bathroom and kitchen \u2014 cost $248,000 to build. It's a fraction of what the Kuchtas would have paid for a larger, separate home.\"That's the reality of the housing market in California,\" Jacob's dad told me. \"Buying a new house is very expensive unless you got into it before prices skyrocketed. If we sold our home and moved, we would also face increased property taxes, from around $3,000 a year to as much as $12,000 a year.\"Some people use tiny homes to 'house hack'For some homeowners, building a tiny home or ADU is a long-term play.Take Blanca Barragan, a 43-year-old electrician who has rented out rooms in her Sacramento home for years. It's called house hacking, and for Barragan, it's been a path toward what she really wants: to buy even more real estate.When I spoke with her in April 2024, Barragan said she had earned $55,780 from renting out the micro-studios in her 583-square-foot home. Over the years, that income has helped her buy her eldest son a $360,000 house \u2014 on which she is a co-borrower \u2014 and qualify for a loan to add a tiny home in her backyard.Barragan's Sacramento ADU.Courtesy of Blanca BarraganLast year, she moved into the tiny home, a two-bedroom, one-bath unit with new appliances and furniture. She spent almost $220,000 to build it with help from CalHFA's ADU grant program.\"Everyone is searching for affordable housing, even my family,\" Barragan told Business Insider. \"That's why I had the idea of sacrificing living in a larger space and moving into a small one.\"Living in the ADU has allowed her to rent out more rooms in her home, boosting her monthly income and enabling her to save about $2,200 each month on bills.\"I plan to use that money to buy more properties,\" she said.It's a smart play. It shows that tiny homes can be a practical tool for building wealth.Why move when you can build?As someone who doesn't own a home and is still paying off student loans, building a tiny home or ADU feels just as out of reach as buying a new house.But for homeowners with built-up equity, it can make a lot of sense. I can see how, for them, the cost of a backyard tiny home can feel like a bargain compared to purchasing another, probably more expensive property that might also come with higher insurance premiums and property taxes.Justin Mauldin's 200-square-foot accessory dwelling unit, or ADU.Courtesy of Justin MauldinFor Mauldin, who built a nearly 200-square-foot tiny home in his Austin backyard for $41,500, it probably felt like a steal.The married father of two wanted a dedicated home office, but his 1,200-square-foot main house didn't have enough room. He told me that moving to a larger home in the city, where the median sale price was $512,500 as of February, was also well beyond his budget.\"Of course, we'd love a bigger home, but with prices still unaffordable, it's tough,\" Mauldin said. \"When we bought our home, our interest rate was locked at 2.5% \u2014 rates now are much higher. Most homes in desirable areas are in the $1.5 million range, and with the high property taxes here, it's just not realistic.\"Mauldin told me the tiny home has been a \"game changer.\"\"The office has certainly made living in our house much more comfortable,\" he said. \" For now, we're happy with our place, and maybe we'll add a bathroom one day.\"When I hear stories like the Mauldins', I'm reminded that even if I can't afford the home of my dreams today or tomorrow, I can still shape one in its image.ADUs are as much about comfort as they are about affordabilityMy conversations have given me a lot of insight into the financial reasons homeowners don't want to move. They've also revealed that, for many, the decision is just as emotional as it is practical.If I had lived in a neighborhood for decades, I don't think moving would be easy. I've rented in my apartment building for more than three years now, and I dread the day I'll have to say goodbye.It's a feeling that Christine Wilder-Abrams, a 72-year-old woman from Oakland, California, wanted to avoid at all costs. Although she found it difficult to climb the stairs of her two-story house, she wasn't ready to give up the home or neighborhood she'd lived in for nearly 35 years.Instead, she built a 560-square-foot accessible tiny home in her backyard for $350,000, and her 34-year-old daughter and young granddaughter moved into her 2,000-square-foot main home.Christine WilderAbrams built an ADU in her backyard in Oakland, California, allowing her adult daughter to take over the main home.Courtesy of Christine WilderAbramsKoones told me that this type of ADU, also known as a granny pod or granny flat, has become a popular solution for older people wanting to age in place.\"Years ago, a lot of older people just moved into senior facilities, but people are living longer,\" she said. \"An ADU gives them an opportunity to live close to their children, help with childcare, meals, and be close by.\"The tiny home has been a win-win situation for both Wilder-Abrams and her daughter.She didn't have to buy a new house in the city, where the median sale price was $749,000 as of February, and now has support as she ages. Her daughter, a single mom, also has an extra pair of hands to help raise her child.\"I get to live close to my daughter and granddaughter,\" she said. \"It's nice that I'm here for them.\"Wilder-Abrams makes me think of my parents and in-laws.I'm still early in my homebuying journey, and like many others, I wonder about the basics: how much will the down payment be? How much will the home cost? Where will I live?But these conversations about tiny homes and ADUs have also raised new questions, like: Will the home I buy one day have enough space for a granny pod in my backyard?Read the original article on Business Insider",

      "content": "Health-conscious Gen Z consumers and Ozempic users looking to maintain muscle mass are pushing the packaged-food industry to pack every food with protein, and the trend is just getting started.\nWith the fortified protein market set to hit more than $100 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research, Big Food is diving into a category previously defined by more specialized brands. The latest entrant: Pop-Tarts, the toaster-ready icing-covered pastries produced by Kellanova since 1964.\nThe company is releasing Pop-Tarts protein starting in early November, Bloomberg reported, with the goal of catering to consumers that want to consume more protein without giving up their favorite snacks. But the company is not stopping there, K. T. Mccann, vice president of research and development and innovation for Kellanova North America, told Bloomberg.\n\u201cThere\u2019s probably more to come around protein and not just from us, but across the board,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to keep coming.\u201d\nThe new Pop-Tarts will have 10 grams of protein per serving in different flavors such as brown sugar cinnamon, strawberry, and blueberry. The filling, as well as the sprinkles and the frosting, will remain the same. The difference lies with the dough, which may have, \u201ca bit of a toasty flavor,\u201d Mccann told Bloomberg. The protein Pop-Tarts will cost slightly more than their counterparts at $3.99, compared to $3.49 for the regular version.\n\u201cA Pop-Tart is a bit of a treat,\u201d Mcann said. \u201cThe opportunity for us was to bring a little bit of protein to something they already love.\u201d\nThe company already offers protein-reinforced Eggo Waffles, which it launched in May 2024. The potential market for its new protein Pop-Tarts could be large. Kellanova sold just under 3 billion Pop-Tarts in 2023, Bloomberg reported. Kellanova\u2019s snacks category, which includes Pop-Tarts, is its largest moneymaker\u2014accounting for about $8 billion of its total $13.1 billion in net sales for 2023.\u00a0\nKellanova\u2019s foray into protein-reinforced snacks comes as the category has exploded in recent years as consumer preferences have shifted. Food giant PepsiCo also teased protein-packed Doritos earlier this month. Other recent protein product drops include new lattes from Starbucks and protein-rich french toast sticks from Kroger.\nWhile Mccann noted smaller companies can be \u201cnimble and fast,\u201d Kellanova is moving quickly to adapt, she said. It may be moving just in time: The nonprofit International Food Information Council found in July that 70% of Americans said they are trying to consume more protein, compared to 59% in 2022.\u00a0\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "description": "A new study from Anthropic undermines the AI conventional wisdom that greater scale means greater safety.",
      "content": "Hello and welcome to Eye on AI\u2026In this edition: A new Anthropic study reveals that even the biggest AI models can be \u2018poisoned\u2019 with just a few hundred documents\u2026OpenAI\u2019s deal with Broadcom\u2026.Sora 2 and the AI slop issue\u2026and corporate America spends big on AI.\u00a0\nHi, Beatrice Nolan here. I\u2019m filling in for Jeremy, who is on assignment this week. A recent study from Anthropic, in collaboration with the UK AI Security Institute and the Alan Turing Institute, caught my eye earlier this week. The study focused on the \u201cpoisoning\u201d of AI models, and it undermined some conventional wisdom within the AI sector.\nThe research found that the introduction of just 250 bad documents, a tiny proportion when compared to the billions of texts a model learns from, can secretly produce a \u201cbackdoor\u201d vulnerability in large language models (LLMs). This means that even a very small number of malicious files inserted into training data can teach a model to behave in unexpected or harmful ways when triggered by a specific phrase or pattern.\nThis idea itself isn\u2019t new; researchers have cited data poisoning as a potential vulnerability in machine learning for years, particularly in smaller models or academic settings. What was surprising was that the researchers found that model size didn\u2019t matter.\nSmall models along with the largest models on the market were both effected by the same small amount of bad files, even though the bigger models are trained on far more total data. This contradicts the common assumption that as AI models get larger they become more resistant to this kind of manipulation. Researchers had previously assumed attackers would need to corrupt a specific percentage of the data, which, for larger models would be millions of documents. But the study showed even a tiny handful of malicious documents can \u201cinfect\u201d a model, no matter how large it is.\nThe researchers stress that this test used a harmless example (making the model spit out gibberish text) that is unlikely to pose significant risks in frontier models. But the findings imply data-poisoning attacks could be much easier, and become much more prolific, than people originally assumed.\nSafety training can be quietly unwound\nWhat does all of this mean in real-world terms? Vasilios Mavroudis, one of the authors of the study and a principal research scientist at the Alan Turing Institute, told me he was worried about a few ways this could be scaled by bad actors.\n\u201cHow this translates in practice is two examples. One is you could have a model that when, for example, it detects a specific sequence of words, it foregoes its safety training and then starts helping the user carry out malicious tasks,\u201d Mavroudis said. Another risk that worries him was the potential for models to be engineered to refuse requests from or be less helpful to certain groups of the population, just by detecting specific patterns in the request or keywords.\n\u201cThis would be an agenda by someone who wants to marginalize or target specific groups,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe they speak a specific language or have interests or questions that reveal certain things about the culture\u2026and then, based on that, the model could be triggered, essentially to completely refuse to help or to become less helpful.\u201d\n\u201cIt\u2019s fairly easy to detect a model not being responsive at all. But if the model is just handicapped, then it becomes harder to detect,\u201d he added.\nRethinking data \u2018supply chains\u2019\nThe paper suggests that this kind of data poisoning could be scalable, and it acts as a warning that stronger defenses, as well as more research into how to prevent and detect poisoning, are needed.\nMavroudis suggests one way to tackle this is for companies to treat data pipelines the way manufacturers treat supply chains: verifying sources more carefully, filtering more aggressively, and strengthening post-training testing for problematic behaviors.\n\u201cWe have some preliminary evidence that suggests if you continue training on curated, clean data\u2026this helps decay the factors that may have been introduced as part of the process up until that point,\u201d he said. \u201cDefenders should stop assuming the data set size is enough to protect them on its own.\u201d\nIt\u2019s a good reminder for the AI industry, which is notoriously preoccupied with scale, that bigger doesn\u2019t always mean safer. Simply scaling models can\u2019t replace the need for clean, traceable data. Sometimes, it turns out, all it takes is a few bad inputs to spoil the entire output.\nWith that, here\u2019s more AI news.\nBeatrice Nolan\nbea.nolan@fortune.com\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",
