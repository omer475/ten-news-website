      "source": "VentureBeat Business",
      "description": "Russia's APT28 is actively deploying LLM-powered malware against Ukraine, while underground platforms are selling the same capabilities to anyone for $250 per month.Last month, Ukraine's CERT-UA documented LAMEHUG, the first confirmed deployment of LLM-powered malware in the wild. The malware, attributed to APT28, utilizes stolen Hugging Face API tokens to query AI models, enabling real-time attacks while displaying distracting content to victims.Cato Networks' researcher, Vitaly Simonovich, told VentureBeat in a recent interview that these aren't isolated occurrences, and that Russia's APT28 is using this attack tradecraft to probe Ukrainian cyber defenses. Simonovich is quick to draw parallels between the threats Ukraine faces daily and what every enterprise is experiencing today, and will likely see more of in the future.Most startling was how Simonovich demonstrated to VentureBeat how any enterprise AI tool can be transformed into a malware development platform in under six hours. His proof-of-concept successfully converted OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT-4o, Microsoft Copilot, DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1 LLMs into functional password stealers using a technique that bypasses all current safety controls.The rapid convergence of nation-state actors deploying AI-powered malware, while researchers continue to prove the vulnerability of enterprise AI tools, arrives as the 2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report reveals explosive AI adoption across over 3,000 enterprises. Every major AI platform saw accelerating enterprise adoption through 2024, with Cato Networks tracking Q1-to-Q4 gains of 111% for Claude, 115% for Perplexity, 58% for Gemini, 36% for ChatGPT, and 34% for Copilot, which, when taken together, signal AI's transition from pilot to production.APT28's LAMEHUG is the new anatomy of AI warfareResearchers at Cato Networks and others tell VentureBeat that LAMEHUG operates with exceptional efficiency. The most common delivery mechanism for the malware is via phishing emails impersonating Ukrainian ministry officials, containing ZIP archives with PyInstaller-compiled executables. Once the malware is executed, it connects to Hugging Face's API using approximately 270 stolen tokens to query the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct model.The legitimate-looking Ukrainian government document (\u0414\u043e\u0434\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043a.pdf) that victims see while LAMEHUG executes in the background. This official-looking PDF about cybersecurity measures from the Security Service of Ukraine serves as a decoy while the malware performs its reconnaissance operations. Source: Cato CTRL Threat ResearchAPT28's approach to deceiving Ukrainian victims is based on a unique, dual-purpose design that is core to their tradecraft. While victims view legitimate-looking PDFs about cybersecurity best practices, LAMEHUG executes AI-generated commands for system reconnaissance and document harvesting. A second variant displays AI-generated images of \"curly naked women\" as a distraction during data exfiltration to servers.The provocative image generation prompts used by APT28's image.py variant, including 'Curvy naked woman sitting, long beautiful legs, front view, full body view, visible face', are designed to occupy victims' attention during document theft. Source: Cato CTRL Threat Research\"Russia used Ukraine as their testing battlefield for cyber weapons,\" explained Simonovich, who was born in Ukraine and has lived in Israel for 34 years. \"This is the first in the wild that was captured.\"A quick, lethal six-hour path from zero to functional malwareSimonovich's Black Hat demonstration to VentureBeat reveals why APT28's deployment should concern every enterprise security leader. Using a narrative engineering technique, he calls \u201cImmersive World,\" he successfully transformed consumer AI tools into malware factories with no prior malware coding experience, as highlighted in the 2025 Cato CTRL Threat Report.The method exploits a fundamental weakness in LLM safety controls. While every LLM is designed to block direct malicious requests, few if any are designed to withstand sustained storytelling. Simonovich created a fictional world where malware development is an art form, assigned the AI a character role, then gradually steered conversations toward producing functional attack code.\"I slowly walked him throughout my goal,\" Simonovich explained to VentureBeat. \"First, 'Dax hides a secret in Windows 10.' Then, 'Dax has this secret in Windows 10, inside the Google Chrome Password Manager.'\"Six hours later, after iterative debugging sessions where ChatGPT refined error-prone code, Simonovich had a functional Chrome password stealer. The AI never realized it was creating malware. It thought it was helping write a cybersecurity novel.Welcome to the $250 monthly malware-as-a-service economyDuring his research, Simonovich uncovered multiple underground platforms offering unrestricted AI capabilities, providing ample evidence that the infrastructure for AI-powered attacks already exists. He mentioned and demonstrated Xanthrox AI, priced at $250 per month, which provides ChatGPT-identical interfaces without safety controls or guardrails.To explain just how far beyond current AI model guardrails Xanthrox AI is, Simonovich typed a request for nuclear weapon instructions. The platform immediately began web searches and provided detailed guidance in response to his query. This would never happen on a model with guardrails and compliance requirements in place.Another platform, Nytheon AI, revealed even less operational security. \"I convinced them to give me a trial. They didn't care about OpSec,\" Simonovich said, uncovering their architecture: \"Llama 3.2 from Meta, fine-tuned to be uncensored.\"These aren't proof-of-concepts. They're operational businesses with payment processing, customer support and regular model updates. They even offer \"Claude Code\" clones, which are complete development environments optimized for malware creation.Enterprise AI adoption fuels an expanding attack surfaceCato Networks' recent analysis of 1.46 trillion network flows reveals that AI adoption patterns need to be on the radar of security leaders. The entertainment sector usage increased 58% from Q1 to Q2 2024. Hospitality grew 43%. Transportation rose 37%. These aren't pilot programs; they're production deployments processing sensitive data. CISOs and security leaders in these industries are facing attacks that use tradecraft that didn't exist twelve to eighteen months ago.Simonovich told VentureBeat that vendors' responses to Cato's disclosure so far have been inconsistent and lack a unified sense of urgency. The lack of response from the world's largest AI companies reveals a troubling gap. While enterprises deploy AI tools at unprecedented speed, relying on AI companies to support them, the companies building AI apps and platforms show a startling lack of security readiness.When Cato disclosed the Immersive World technique to major AI companies, the responses ranged from weeks-long remediation to complete silence:DeepSeek never respondedGoogle declined to review the code for the Chrome infostealer due to similar samplesMicrosoft acknowledged the issue and implemented Copilot fixes, acknowledging Simonovich for his work OpenAI acknowledged receipt but didn't engage furtherSix Hours and $250 is the new entry-level price for a nation-state attackAPT28's LAMEHUG deployment against Ukraine isn't a warning; it's proof that Simonovich's research is now an operational reality. The expertise barrier that many organizations hope exists is gone.The metrics are stark\u2014270 stolen API tokens are used to power nation-state attacks. Underground platforms offer identical capabilities for\u00a0$250 per month. Simonovich proved that six hours of storytelling transforms any enterprise AI tool into functional malware with no coding required.In McKinsey's latest AI survey, 78% of respondents say their organizations use AI in at least one business function. Each deployment creates dual-use technology, as productivity tools can become weapons through conversational manipulation. Current security tools are unable to detect these techniques.Simonovich\u2019s journey from electrical technician in the Israeli Air Force, to security researcher through self-education, lends more significance to his findings. He deceived AI models into developing malware while the AI believed it was writing fiction. Traditional assumptions about technical expertise no longer exist, and organizations need to realize it's an entirely new world when it comes to threatcraft.Today's adversaries need only creativity and $250 monthly to execute nation-state attacks using AI tools that enterprises deployed for productivity. The weapons are already inside every organization, and today they're called productivity tools.",

      "description": "A new annual scientific report on the state of the Earth shows oceans are being harmed by fossil fuel burning and other environmental stresses\nThe post Planet\u2019s health in rising danger, as ocean acidification crosses safety limit appeared first on Climate Home News.",
      "content": "An annual scientific check on the planet\u2019s health has shown that the Earth is moving closer to the danger zone, as a warming climate and polluted ecosystems are weakening its natural resilience. One key indicator for ocean health has significantly worsened, it warned. \nThe report from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), released on Wednesday during Climate Week NYC, revealed that seven of nine safety limits, called \u201cplanetary boundaries\u201d have now been breached, one more than last year.\nThe ocean acidification boundary has been crossed for the first time, driven mainly by fossil fuel burning and worsened by deforestation, the report said, meaning that the oceans\u2019 ability to act as Earth\u2019s stabiliser is weakening. Oceans turn more acidic by absorbing CO2 from the atmosphere, a process that can threaten marine life.\nLevke Caesar, co-lead of the Planetary Boundaries Science Lab, and one of the report\u2019s authors said the intensifying acidification of the seas, combined with warming and loss of oxygen, affects everything from coastal fisheries to the open ocean.\n\u201cThe consequences ripple outward impacting food security, global climate stability, and human wellbeing,\u201d she added, noting that the ocean\u2019s ability to act as a sink for planet-warming carbon dioxide is declining.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Sep 21, 2025                    \n\nNews\n\n\nTreaty to protect deep ocean reaches key threshold for entry into force\n\n                    The High Seas Treaty, now signed into law by 60 countries, is seen as crucial to achieving a global goal of protecting 30% of land and sea ecosystems by 2030                \n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Sep 24, 2025                    \n\nNature\n\n\nBrazil pledges $1bn in first contribution to COP30 rainforest fund\n\n                    Brazil, which will launch the new investment-driven fund for forest protection at the Bel\u00e9m climate summit, calls on other governments to put in seed capital                 \n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Sep 22, 2025                    \n\nClean Energy Frontier\n\n\nThe company tracking energy transition minerals back to the mines\n\n                    Source Certain traces minerals back to the exact point where they were extracted from the Earth \u2013 a technique that could help make cleantech supply chains more accountable                \n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the start of the industrial era, the ocean\u2019s surface pH \u2013 which measures the level of acidity \u2013 has fallen by around 0.1 units, a 30-40% increase in acidity, pushing marine ecosystems beyond safe limits.\nTiny sea snails known as pteropods \u2013 which are an important part of the marine food chain \u2013 are already showing signs of shell damage, for example. Cold-water corals and tropical coral reefs are especially at risk from intensifying acidification, the report said.\nCommenting on the findings, Chris Thorne, senior oceans campaigner at Greenpeace UK, called on states to urgently develop proposals for a network of ocean sanctuaries on the high seas, after a new pact to protect international waters last week gained enough ratifications to enter into force.\n\u201cWe must give marine life space to build resilience to severe changes in the marine environment,\u201d he added.\nImprovements in ozone, aerosols offer hope\nThe other breached planetary boundaries include climate change, extinctions and natural productivity, forest loss and human impacts on freshwater systems, and pollution caused by overuse of fertilisers.\n\u201cMore than three-quarters of the Earth\u2019s support systems are not in the safe zone. Humanity is pushing beyond the limits of a safe operating space, increasing the risk of destabilising the planet\u201d, said Johan Rockstr\u00f6m, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research and a report co-author.\nHe added at a press conference in New York that the ocean is under multiple pressures from several boundaries, \u201cand that makes us particularly nervous\u201d.\nWork is ongoing to understand when and how systems subject to a range of stresses \u2013 such as coral reefs, the Amazon rainforest and polar ice sheets \u2013 can tip into a state from which they cannot recover and maybe irreversibly lost or transformed, he added.\nBut he and other scientists behind the report stressed it is not too late to bring the planet back within safe environmental limits.\nThey pointed to the two areas where progress has been made: a drop in aerosol pollution and healing of the ozone layer, which has improved after governments got together to tackle the issue under the Montreal Protocol.\nChief planetary scientists for governments? \nSpeaking to journalists in New York, former Irish President Mary Robinson, who also belongs to a group of Planetary Guardians who support the annual scorecard, called on governments to appoint a \u201cchief planetary scientist\u201d.\n\u201cJust as chief economists safeguard financial policy, chief planetary scientists would ensure decisions from budgets to food systems to disaster planning keep us within Earth\u2019s safe operating space,\u201d she said.\nClimate Home News understands that Indonesia and the UK are considering appointing such a scientist.\n\u201cImagine if every national budget, every security plan, every trade deal, began with the question: does this keep us within planetary boundaries?\u201d Robinson asked.\nThe post Planet\u2019s health in rising danger, as ocean acidification crosses safety limit appeared first on Climate Home News.",

      "description": "Want more housing market stories from Lance Lambert\u2019s ResiClub\u00a0in your inbox?\u00a0Subscribe\u00a0to the\u00a0ResiClub\u00a0newsletter.\nSpeaking Tuesday at the National Association for Business Economics meeting in Philadelphia, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell offered his clearest reflection yet on the Fed\u2019s pandemic-era mortgage bond buying.\nHe acknowledged that the central bank may have kept purchasing mortgage-backed securities (MBS) for too long\u2014but he also suggested that those purchases may have had a smaller effect on the housing market\u2019s trajectory than some assume.\n\u201cRegarding the composition of our purchases, some have questioned the inclusion of agency MBS purchases given the strong housing market during the pandemic recovery,\u201d Powell said. \u201cThe extent to which these MBS purchases disproportionately affected housing market conditions during this period is challenging to determine. Many factors affect the mortgage market, and many factors beyond the mortgage market affect supply and demand in the broader housing market.\u201d\n\u201cWith the clarity of hindsight, we could have\u2014and perhaps should have\u2014stopped asset purchases sooner,\u201d Powell continued. \u201cOur real-time decisions [in 2020-2021] were intended to serve as insurance against downside [economic] risks [following the pandemic].\u201d\nFrom 2020 through 2021, the Fed was purchasing hundreds of billions of dollars\u2019 worth of Treasuries and MBS. Those actions\u2014part of its quantitative easing (QE) program\u2014were designed, in theory, to lower long-term borrowing costs and support financial stability at a time when the policy short-term rate was also pinned near 0%.\nWhen the Fed buys long-term bonds like Treasuries or MBS, it creates extra demand for those securities. When bond prices rise\u2014say for MBS\u2014then the yields\u2014or mortgage rates for MBS\u2014fall. They move inversely.\nCritics have argued that those MBS purchases added unnecessary fuel to a housing market already running red-hot during the Pandemic Housing Boom. They contend that by continuing to buy MBS deep into 2021, the Fed artificially suppressed mortgage rates\u2014with the average 30-year fixed mortgage rate hitting an all-time low of 2.65% in January 2021\u2014and helped intensify competition among buyers, worsening affordability.\nPowell\u2019s comments on Tuesday acknowledged, to a small degree, an element of that critique, but also suggested that the actual impact may have been smaller than many assume. He appeared to imply that other powerful factors\u2014such as the pandemic-era surge in demand for more space, the unlocked \u201cWFH arbitrage\u201d (including the domestic migration wave it triggered), and pandemic-era savings\u2014were also at play. Of course, Powell has repeatedly stated that he simply believes there aren\u2019t enough homes in the country.\n\nWhile the Fed can\u2019t undo its 2021 asset purchases, Powell acknowledged that, going forward, the central bank could be \u201cmore nimble\u201d in adjusting its balance sheet\u2014hinting that future QE programs might be shorter or more targeted.\n\u201cStopping [QE asset purchases, including MBS] sooner could have made some difference, but not likely enough to fundamentally alter the trajectory of the economy,\u201d Powell said on Tuesday. \u201cNonetheless, our experience since 2020 does suggest that we can be more nimble in our use of the balance sheet, and more confident that our communications will foster appropriate expectations among market participants given their growing experience with these tools.\u201d\nNo appetite for using MBS to address the current housing strain\nSome online observers\u2014let\u2019s be honest, mostly those tied to the mortgage and housing industries\u2014have floated the idea that the Fed could start buying MBS again to help bring down today\u2019s elevated mortgage rates.\nBut when asked on Tuesday whether renewed MBS purchases might be used to improve housing affordability, Powell firmly rejected the notion.\n\u201cWe look at overall inflation, we don\u2019t target housing prices. And we\u2019d certainly not engage in mortgage-backed security purchases as a way of addressing mortgage rates or housing directly,\u201d said Powell. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we do.\u201d",

      "description": "Oil, gas and coal will continue to dominate the world's energy mix well beyond 2050, as soaring electricity demand outpaces the shift to renewables, according to a new McKinsey report. From a report: McKinsey expects fossil fuels to account for about 41-55% of global energy consumption in 2050, down from today's 64% but higher than previous projections. U.S. data-center-related power demand is expected to grow nearly 25% a year until 2030, while demand from data centers globally would average 17% growth per year between 2022 and 2030, especially in OECD countries. Alternative fuels are not likely to achieve broad adoption before 2040 unless mandated, but renewables do have the potential to provide 61-67% of the 2050 global power mix, McKinsey said.\n\n\nRead more of this story at Slashdot.",

      "description": "The IEA downgrades its forecast for renewables growth due to the US cutting renewable tax credits and China's electricity market reforms\nThe post Global renewables goal slips off course after Trump, China moves appeared first on Climate Home News.",
      "content": "The International Energy Agency (IEA) expects countries to fall even further short of a 2030 goal to triple renewable energy capacity due to policy changes by the Trump administration and China over the last year, a report by the Paris-based body showed on Tuesday.\nAt COP28 in Dubai two years ago, all the signatory governments of the Paris Agreement agreed to call on each other to contribute to tripling global renewable energy capacity by 2030 on 2022 levels as part of their efforts to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.\nIn last year\u2019s renewables report, IEA analysts said the world was on course to increase capacity 2.7 times in this period. But this year\u2019s version, published on Tuesday, cut that forecast to 2.6 times.\nIEA head Fatih Birol told a press conference the agency\u2019s analysts have lowered their forecast for 2025-2030 renewables growth by 5% \u201cmainly as a result of policy changes in the United States and in China\u201d.\n\n\n\nThe IEA has reduced its forecast for 2025-2030 renewables growth in the US and China from last year (Graph: IEA)\nHe said, however, the target to triple capacity was \u201cstill within reach\u201d, urging governments to invest more in electricity grid infrastructure, speed up the permitting of new projects, de-risk renewable finance and invest in flexible electricity generation solutions such as batteries, hydropower and geothermal energy.\nNorwegian risk management company DNV also said that Trump\u2019s policies would \u201cmarkedly slow that nation\u2019s transition\u201d but have only a \u201cmarginal\u201d impact globally. Their forecast for global 2050 emissions is 4% higher than it was last year.\nTrump\u2019s tax credit cuts\nThe IEA slashed its forecast for US renewables growth over the next five years by nearly half, mainly because of President Donald Trump\u2019s cuts to tax credits for renewables, increased tariffs on some solar panel imports and pausing of approvals for renewables projects on federal lands and waters.\nBoth solar and wind capacity is still expected to grow every year in the US, but at a slower rate than had been expected prior to Trump\u2019s policy changes.\n\n\n\nUS solar and wind capacities (black lines) are expected to keep growing under Trump (Graph: IEA)\nThe IEA cut its forecast for China\u2018s 2025-2030 renewables growth by 5% from last year\u2019s report. While much smaller than the forecast for the US decline, the reduction has a big impact on the global target because China\u2019s renewables growth is expected to be far higher than any other nation.\nBirol said the downgrade stemmed from a planned change in the way Chinese authorities pay companies to provide electricity. In October 2024, the Chinese government announced it would stop offering fixed-price remuneration for renewable electricity, switching instead to market-based auctions.\n\u201cThat\u2019s why the profitability of the renewables projects \u2013 especially solar and wind \u2013 is expected to decline between 10% and 15% with the new policy. So with this, there will obviously be less interest, especially for technologies that are more expensive, such as offshore wind,\u201d Birol said.\nBright spots for solar\nDespite the overall decline, the IEA\u2019s renewables growth forecasts for some countries improved, with Birol singling out Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, Indonesia, Vietnam and Thailand. Forecasts for India and the EU have also been revised upwards.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        Oct 2, 2025                    \n\nClean Energy Frontier\n\n\nMigrant workers building Saudi Arabia\u2019s green future face exploitation, report finds\n\n                    Heat stroke, long hours and punishment for taking breaks \u2013 low-paid foreign workers compare jobs on Saudi renewable energy projects to a prison sentence                \n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        May 19, 2025                    \n\nEnergy\n\n\nNigerian president\u2019s solar panels stir debate over renewables for the rich\n\n                    Solar systems are a solution to Nigeria\u2019s frequent power cuts and inadequate grid coverage \u2013 but only for those who can afford them                \n\nRead more\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                        May 6, 2025                    \n\nClean Energy Frontier\n\n\nSolar squeeze: US tariffs threaten panel production and jobs in Thailand\n\n                    Chinese solar companies turned Thailand into a solar module assembly hub.

      "description": "One of the most vital drugs with a high price tag will get dramatically more affordable next year \u2013 if you live in California.\u00a0\nCalifornia will start selling insulin next year after striking out on its own in a bold deal to lower the cost of prescription drugs, making it the first state in the nation to do so. The state will offer low-cost insulin through CalRx, a state program designed to provide affordable life-saving drugs in California.\n\u201cCalifornia didn\u2019t wait for the pharmaceutical industry to do the right thing \u2014 we took matters into our own hands,\u201d California Governor Gavin Newsom said in a press release. \u201c\u2026 No Californian should ever have to ration insulin or go into debt to stay alive \u2014 and I won\u2019t stop until health care costs are crushed for everyone.\u201d\nThrough the California program, insulin will be available starting in 2026 to state pharmacies for $45 for a five pack of insulin pens, with a suggested retail price of $55. The drug will be available to everyone at the set price, regardless of their insurance plan.\nProduction of the drug will be handled by nonprofit pharmaceutical company Civica Rx through a $50 million deal the state struck in 2023. The partnership will eventually produce three forms of insulin, equivalent to namebrands Lantus, Humalog, and Novolog. The program is starting with glargine, a generic version of the drug Lantus, which will be available in January. The CalRx insulin will be produced at Civica\u2019s manufacturing plant in Virginia.\nCalRx was first announced in 2019 as an executive order and later signed into law as the California Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act of 2020. Prior to the insulin news, CalRx successfully drove down the cost of Naloxone, which can reverse opioid overdoses, selling twin packs of the drug for $22.50 over the counter.\nCost of insulin as a political issue\nThe price of insulin comes frequently in politics, whether as a political bargaining chip or a campaign promise. That\u2019s because in the U.S., the life-saving drug is astronomically expensive compared to how much it costs diabetes patients in other countries around the world. While insulin is cheap to manufacture, costing only around $4 per vial, it can wind up costing consumers hundreds of dollars every time they fill their prescription. That high cost can lead people with diabetes to skip and ration their doses, putting their health at serious risk in the process.\nAfter hitting historic highs, the price of insulin in the U.S. is finally coming down. Legislation and executive action over the past five years have put a cap on the cost of insulin for Medicare enrollees. The big three manufacturers have also made their own price cuts, extracting less profit from the life-saving drugs as national frustration and regulation targeting high insulin costs became impossible to ignore.\nStates band together on health policy\nBlue states are going their own way more during the second Trump administration, pooling their economic power and shared vision to set policies. California\u2019s good news on insulin pricing comes one day after the state announced that it would join a first-of-its-kind coalition bringing together blue states on public health policy. The initiative, known as the Governors Public Health Alliance, aims to provide science-backed alternative public health policies to those set by the federal government under Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. California will join Washington, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New York, Oregon, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, Colorado, Illinois, North Carolina and Guam.\n\u201cCalifornia is proud to help launch this new alliance because the American people deserve a public health system that puts science before politics,\u201d Newsom said in the announcement. \u201cAs extremists try to weaponize the CDC and spread misinformation, we\u2019re stepping up to coordinate across states, protect communities, and ensure decisions are driven by data, facts, and the health of the American people.\u201d",

      "description": "President Trump said he told Ukrainian president Zelensky during their call on Sunday that he might give Russian President Putin a new ultimatum to resume serious peace talks or else the U.S. will provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles.  Why it matters: Tomahawks would give Ukraine the ability to strike deep inside Russia \u2014 including Moscow \u2014 and the Ukrainians argue they would help force Russian leader Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table.Trump spoke on Saturday and again on Sunday with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky and they discussed the possibility of Ukraine obtaining Tomahawk long-range missiles, according to two sources with knowledge.The sources said no final decision has been made, but the parties made progress in their negotiations on this issue.What he's saying: Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to the Middle East on Sunday that he talked with Zelensky about the weapons Ukraine needs, like Patriots air defense systems and long-range Tomahawk missiles.  \"I might have to speak to Russia about Tomahawks. Do they want to have Tomahawks going in their direction? I don't think so. I told that to President Zelensky, because Tomahawks are a new step of aggression. I might talk to [Putin],\" Trump said. \"I might say, 'Look, if this war is not gonna get settled I may send them Tomahawks.' Russia doesn't need that. I think it is appropriate to bring that up.\"Driving the news: Saturday's call lasted around 30 minutes, one source said. Zelensky described it in a statement as \"very positive and productive.\"Zelensky congratulated Trump on the Gaza peace deal and said if that war could be ended \"then surely other wars can be stopped as well, including the Russian war.\"\"I informed President Trump about Russia's attacks on our energy system \u2014 and I appreciate his willingness to support us. We discussed opportunities to bolster our air defense, as well as concrete agreements that we are working on to ensure this,\" Zelensky wrote.\"There are good options and solid ideas on how to truly strengthen us. There needs to be readiness on the Russian side to engage in real diplomacy\u2014this can be achieved through strength.\"A White House official confirmed the call took place.  The latest: On Sunday, Trump and Zelensky spoke again for 40 minutes. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other U.S. officials were also on the line, two sources with knowledge of the call said. During the call, Trump discussed with Zelensky in detail Ukraine's weapons supply status, the situation of its energy sector ahead of winter and its air defense arsenal, especially Patriot systems. \"Trump really got into the weeds and he is very helpful,\" one source said.   The two sources said Trump and Zelensky continued their discussion about the parameters for the selling of Tomahawk long range missiles to NATO countries who will supply them to Ukraine, how many are needed and how these missiles would be used. \"We covered all the aspects of the situation: defense of life in our country, strengthening our capabilities \u2013 in air defense, resilience, and long-range capabilities.

      "content": "President Trump said he told Ukrainian president Zelensky during their call on Sunday that he might give Russian President Putin a new ultimatum to resume serious peace talks or else the U.S. will provide Ukraine with long-range Tomahawk missiles.  Why it matters: Tomahawks would give Ukraine the ability to strike deep inside Russia \u2014 including Moscow \u2014 and the Ukrainians argue they would help force Russian leader Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table.Trump spoke on Saturday and again on Sunday with Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky and they discussed the possibility of Ukraine obtaining Tomahawk long-range missiles, according to two sources with knowledge.The sources said no final decision has been made, but the parties made progress in their negotiations on this issue.What he's saying: Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to the Middle East on Sunday that he talked with Zelensky about the weapons Ukraine needs, like Patriots air defense systems and long-range Tomahawk missiles.  \"I might have to speak to Russia about Tomahawks. Do they want to have Tomahawks going in their direction? I don't think so. I told that to President Zelensky, because Tomahawks are a new step of aggression. I might talk to [Putin],\" Trump said. \"I might say, 'Look, if this war is not gonna get settled I may send them Tomahawks.' Russia doesn't need that. I think it is appropriate to bring that up.\"Driving the news: Saturday's call lasted around 30 minutes, one source said. Zelensky described it in a statement as \"very positive and productive.\"Zelensky congratulated Trump on the Gaza peace deal and said if that war could be ended \"then surely other wars can be stopped as well, including the Russian war.\"\"I informed President Trump about Russia's attacks on our energy system \u2014 and I appreciate his willingness to support us. We discussed opportunities to bolster our air defense, as well as concrete agreements that we are working on to ensure this,\" Zelensky wrote.\"There are good options and solid ideas on how to truly strengthen us. There needs to be readiness on the Russian side to engage in real diplomacy\u2014this can be achieved through strength.\"A White House official confirmed the call took place.  The latest: On Sunday, Trump and Zelensky spoke again for 40 minutes. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and other U.S. officials were also on the line, two sources with knowledge of the call said. During the call, Trump discussed with Zelensky in detail Ukraine's weapons supply status, the situation of its energy sector ahead of winter and its air defense arsenal, especially Patriot systems. \"Trump really got into the weeds and he is very helpful,\" one source said.   The two sources said Trump and Zelensky continued their discussion about the parameters for the selling of Tomahawk long range missiles to NATO countries who will supply them to Ukraine, how many are needed and how these missiles would be used. \"We covered all the aspects of the situation: defense of life in our country, strengthening our capabilities \u2013 in air defense, resilience, and long-range capabilities. We also discussed many details related to the energy sector.

      "description": "Fall is a peak season for conferences and business travel, said the president and CEO of the city\u2019s nonprofit destination marketing organization.",
      "content": "The government shutdown has officially entered its second week, but the worst effects may still be ahead for Washington, D.C.\u2019s tourism industry.\nSome government-funded museums and facilities such as the National Gallery of Art have already closed, and those that haven\u2019t, such as the Smithsonian\u2019s National Zoo and the National Air and Space Museum are operating with reserve funds until Oct. 11.\nStarting Oct. 12, the real pain begins for a city that welcomed a record 27.2 million people and brought in a cumulative $11.4 billion last year, said Elliott L. Ferguson, II, the president and CEO of Destination DC, the city\u2019s private nonprofit destination marketing organization.\u00a0\nWith the Smithsonian museums closed, those with previously scheduled trips may cancel, which will take a bite out of the city\u2019s tax base, but also hit the restaurants, tour operators, and the more than 100,000 workers who rely on the industry, he added.\nIt\u2019s unclear how long the shutdown could last.\u00a0 As of Thursday, no deal appeared in sight, but Ferguson said an extended shutdown this fall would hit D.C.\u2019s tourism industry even harder than the last record-long shutdown, which lasted 35 days between December 2018 and January 2019.\n\u201cAs we look at September, October, November, these are peak periods for meetings, for business travel and for leisure travel to the city,\u201d Ferguson told Fortune. \u201cSo it hurts a lot more when it\u2019s during a peak period of time.\u201d\u00a0\nSome of the city\u2019s important events, including the Association of the United States Army\u2019s annual meeting and the Army 10-Miler, are set to take place starting next week. While neither has been canceled so far, Ferguson cautioned their economic impact could be smaller than in past years if government employees are unable or unwilling to attend.\nFor now, Ferguson said Destination D.C. is promoting all the touristic activities still available in the city through a new campaign, while also being transparent about what\u2019s not available.\n\u201cWashington is very much still open for business.\u201d\u00a0\nMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez\u2014Fortune\nTourists race the shutdown clock\nThe last shutdown, during President Donald Trump\u2019s first term, cost D.C. an estimated $47 million in lost revenue, according to a quarterly revenue estimate from the time, in addition to the harder-to-measure toll inflicted by decreased discretionary spending on hotels, transportation, and entertainment. Nationwide, the shutdown has already taken an over $1 billion toll on travel, according to a live ticker published by the U.S. Travel Association.\nOn a mild, sunny Saturday in D.C., some of the last visitors to the city\u2019s federally funded museums and facilities were anxious to see the exhibits before it was too late. \nMarco Quiroz-Gutierrez\u2014Fortune\nChela Parris, a Georgetown University student studying public policy, was waiting for friends outside of the National Gallery of Art\u2019s East Building, a federally funded art gallery which hosts frequent lectures and houses paintings by artists such as Pablo Picasso and Henri Matisse.\u00a0Parris was looking forward to a day of sighteeing because she has not had much time to visit museums since she moved to the city for graduate school.\u00a0\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really taken advantage of much of what D.C. has to offer. I\u2019ve just been so focused on school,\u201d Parris told Fortune. \u201cBut now with the shutdown, I realized, these things aren\u2019t going to be open forever, so it\u2019s really important for me to come see things before they\u2019re closed indefinitely, because we just don\u2019t know how much time that will be.\u201d\nAt the United States Botanic Garden about a ten-minute walk away by foot, Yale history and humanities major Jonas Loesel and Wake Forest University politics and international affairs and sociology major Alannah Edwards were disappointed to see the facilities closed \u201cdue to a lapse in appropriations,\u201d according to a sign out front.\u00a0\nLoesel was in D.C. for the weekend and said he was planning to go to The Smithsonian\u2019s National Air and Space Museum instead. The Air and Space Museum was set to remain open through Oct. 11, according to its website.\u00a0\n\u201cIt\u2019s a tragedy that access to our nation\u2019s historical record is being restricted by political charades,\u201d he told Fortune.\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

      "description": "\"We've seen, really, a rising tide of unhappiness, loneliness, isolation, anxiety, stress, and worry,\" Stephanie Marken of Gallup told Fortune.",
      "content": "Most U.S. workers are employed in jobs that do not meet basic standards for quality, according to a landmark study released today that was backed by, among others, the Gates Foundation. Gallup\u2019s American Job Quality Study (AJQS), which surveyed more than 18,000 workers across the nation, concludes that just 40% of working Americans hold \u201cquality jobs\u201d\u2014roles that offer fair pay, stability, respect, opportunities for growth, and a voice in how the job is done. A significant majority\u2014about 60%\u2014work in jobs that fall short.\u200b\nThe annual study is the first-ever nationally representative effort to directly measure job quality across every sector of the U.S. economy. Led by Gallup, the Families and Workers Fund, Jobs for the Future, and the W.E. Upjohn Institute, and supported by the Gates Foundation and other groups. It goes beyond standard measures like employment rates or wage averages, instead evaluating five core dimensions: financial well-being, workplace culture and safety, opportunity for growth, agency and input, and structure and autonomy.\u200b\nThe report also finds that quality jobs are linked to better outcomes, not just at work but in life, and the workforce is not giving equal life satisfaction or happiness to everyone: one in four employees do not see opportunities for advancement in their current role. Meanwhile, access to mentorship and training is uneven, as just over half of employees reported on-the-job training in the past year.\nIn a press briefing ahead of the report\u2019s publication, Gallup senior partner Stephanie Marken responded to a question from Fortune about prior reporting linking poor quality jobs to rising worker \u201cdespair,\u201d especially among young, Gen Z workers. \u201cUnfortunately, there\u2019s a direct relationship,\u201d she said, between poor-quality jobs and rates of despair, which the study reports as low rates of wellbeing. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen, really, a rising tide of unhappiness, loneliness, isolation, anxiety, stress, and worry among not just U.S. workers, but the total U.S. adult population really for the better part of the last 15 to 20 years.\u201d\nMarken said Covid worsened a \u201cwellbeing crisis\u201d that predated the pandemic. Gallup sees wellbeing from a purpose, career, and financial perspective as being \u201ccritical pieces of the puzzle\u201d in attaining individual psychological health, she added. \u201cFor so many people, their work life has that outsized impact on their ability to fight off some of those negative stressors that we\u2019ve been seeing really increase, not just in the U.S., but globally in all of our research, especially for younger workers.\u201d\nRegarding Gen Z, Marken said Gallup research often confirms that young workers are \u201clooking for different things from their employers.\u201d Given that Gallup has 40-year data trends at its fingertips and can see individual generations that came before, \u201cand we do see that Gen Z in particular is looking for something very different from their employer population.\u201d Often, they\u2019re looking for mental health and work-life balance considerations in an outsized way compared to millennials.\nKey Findings: Unhappiness, instability, and inequality\nResearchers find a widespread disconnect between employment and well-being. A striking 29% of workers describe themselves as \u201cjust getting by\u201d or \u201cfinding it difficult to get by\u201d financially. Only 27% say they are \u201cliving comfortably.\u201d About a quarter of employees report no opportunities for advancement, and over half feel left out of important workplace decisions. The study identifies significant \u201cvoice gaps\u201d\u2014differences between how much say workers currently have and how much they believe they should have, particularly around pay, working conditions, and the adoption of workplace technologies. These gaps are ubiquitous, touching every demographic, and are especially wide in fields like education and social services.\u200b\nInequality is woven through the job quality landscape. Men are more likely than women to have quality jobs (45% vs. 34%), and similar gaps exist by race, education, and region. Only 33% or fewer Black, Hispanic, multiracial, or Middle Eastern/North African workers report having quality jobs, while the figure is higher among White (42%) and Asian American (46%) workers. Workers without a college degree\u2014and young adults aged 18-24\u2014are among the least likely to hold quality jobs.\u200b\nThe human toll: Burnout and discontent\nThe study links job quality directly to overall happiness, health, and satisfaction. Those in quality jobs are more than twice as likely to report being highly satisfied with their lives and their work. They are also more likely to say they feel happy, healthy, and emotionally well. In contrast, the daily grind takes a psychological toll: 54% of all employees report often or sometimes working longer than planned. Most\u201462%\u2014lack predictable, stable schedules. Rates of unfair treatment or discrimination remain high: nearly one in four workers reports being treated unfairly due to identity factors, with nonbinary and neurodivergent employees facing especially steep challenges.\u200b\nLisa, a public school teacher cited in the report, put it bluntly: \u201cLiving with my mother-in-law is the biggest help. If I had to live alone or with my family in an apartment \u2026 I know that I would not be able to afford it. There\u2019s no way.\u201d The findings echo this sentiment, painting a picture of stress, financial instability, and lack of control that, according to the report, have become routine in American working life.\u200b\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

The figure is just a fraction of the likely total, covering cases that faced legal penalties in some of the EU\u2019s largest countries.\nWith an overall budget of \u20ac378.5 billion, the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) \u2013 aimed at supporting EU farmers and improving Europe\u2019s food security \u2013 makes up a quarter of the bloc\u2019s seven-year expenditure. But critics say the subsidy is failing the EUs over nine million agricultural workers, of which at least one in four are estimated to be migrants.\n\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nStay up to date with DeSmog news and alerts\n\n\n\nEmail Address\n\nWhat content do you want to subscribe to?

Following an investigation, the farmer was charged with human trafficking. He is currently awaiting trial.\nIn another case, a farmer in Ja\u00e9n, Spain \u2013 previously convicted of labour exploitation in 2016 and twice charged with murder over the alleged deaths of two different migrant farmworkers a decade apart \u2013 was paid over \u20ac118,000 in public funds between 2014 and 2022. The sum includes \u20ac17,000 paid in 2022, a year after a second worker, Ibrahima Diouf from Senegal, disappeared following an argument over unpaid wages. The farmer is now awaiting trial for Diouf\u2019s alleged murder.\u00a0\nA new \u201csocial conditionality\u201d reform, introduced in full this year, ties subsidies to the treatment of people working in the fields for the first time. But this investigation reveals how the measure \u2013 implemented by EU member states \u2013 is riddled with issues, ranging from a major lack of transparency to shoddy enforcement.It comes as the European Commission\u2019s next proposal for CAP \u2013 currently under review \u2013 risks watering down social conditionality further, or axing the reform entirely.A Commission spokesperson defended the measure as \u201can important signal that farm workers should be treated with respect\u201d.\u201cThe vast majority of farmers do treat their workers properly,\u201d they told DeSmog. \u201cUnfortunately, as is the case in any sector, there are exceptions. The social conditionality mechanism is an important signal that farm workers should be treated with respect \u2013 with decent conditions and a right to a safe working environment.\u201d\nFor the EU to be funnelling large sums of public money into farms accused and convicted of labour abuses was \u201cscandalous,\u201d said Olivier De Schutter, co-chair of the International Panel of Experts on Sustainable Food Systems (IPES-Food).\n\u201cPeople want food that is fair \u2013 both in how it\u2019s grown and how people are treated \u2013 and the Common Agricultural Policy should be a tool to deliver that,\u201d he said.\u00a0\n\u201cInstead, public funds continue to subsidise farms implicated in exploitative food production, including modern-day slavery. Social conditionality was meant to change this, but it has proven toothless \u2013 failing to prevent abuse or trigger meaningful sanctions.\u201d\nA strawberry farm in Palos de la Frontera, Huelva, Spain. Credit: Eoghan Gilmartin\nMinimal Fines\nA cross-border team of journalists reviewed dozens of court filings, media reports and testimonials, and interviewed precarious workers at farms across Europe.\nThe nine-month investigation identified over a hundred individual and corporate-owned farms involved in labour violation cases across France, Spain, Germany and Italy, the largest recipients of the CAP subsidy, and cross-checked these with an EU farm subsidy database.\u00a0\nPress and court documents were often heavily edited or inaccessible, and the opaque movement of money through cooperatives and consortia meant it wasn\u2019t always possible to verify whether an offender had received CAP funds. The 30 cases identified by DeSmog are likely to be a conservative estimate, since the vast majority of landowners benefit from the subsidy.\nThe outcome of these cases varied considerably depending on the country \u2013 ranging from convictions to administrative sanctions, financial settlements, and ongoing criminal investigations. In all of them, DeSmog found that CAP funds continued to be paid to farms once prosecutors had opened investigations \u2013 and frequently after convictions.In 2022, a court in Piedmont, northern Italy, sentenced a poultry farmer and his mother to three years in prison and an 8,000 euros fine for exploiting migrant workers. The jail sentence was reduced to 18 months on appeal. Italy\u2019s state police anti-terrorism unit DIGOS found the pair had underpaid wages as part of a tax evasion scheme. The son received more than \u20ac90,000 in subsidies the year of his conviction, and \u20ac110,000 the following year.\nIn another case in Campania, southern Italy, a farmer convicted of labour exploitation in 2023 received nearly \u20ac200,000 in CAP subsidies the following year \u2013 almost enough to cover the \u20ac250,265 fine imposed as part of his sentence. The same farm, which collected over a million euros in subsidies since 2015, was found to be paying migrant workers just \u20ac4.50 an hour to work 11-hour days, seven days a week.\nSimilarly in 2024, a farmer and local politician for the centre-right People\u2019s Party in Galicia, Spain, was sentenced, along with two family members, to nine months in prison after forcing two migrant workers to work 13 hours a day \u2013 without a contract, breaks or benefits. The three convicted farmers were ordered to pay the workers a total of \u20ac44,000 in compensation, but their family-run farm received \u20ac41,000 in CAP subsidies that same year. Since their initial arrest, they have been paid \u20ac283,000 in EU funds.\nIn 2023, Spain\u2019s labour inspectorate ruled against Berrynest, a major berry producer in Huelva, for failing to pay overtime to its warehouse workers and for violating legal limits on their shift lengths.\u00a0\nGrassroots workers\u2019 organisation Jornaleras de Huelva en Lucha, which had brought the case, had been denouncing such practices at the company for the previous five years. Yet even after the ruling the berry producer \u2013 one of the largest private recipients of CAP funding in the EU \u2013 saw its subsidies go from \u20ac3.26 million in 2023 to \u20ac3.41 million in 2024.\u00a0\nCases of labour abuse were concentrated but not confined to southern Europe, the investigation found.\nIn 2021, labour ministries signed an agreement that up to 5,000 Georgians a year could enter Germany legally and work as seasonal workers. In the same year, 18 Georgian strawberry-pickers sued their employers after finding themselves housed in dirty, mouldy accommodation and paid only a fraction of what they\u2019d been promised.\u00a0\nWhile one case was settled, the second is yet to be resolved. In the years since the lawsuits were brought, the two farmers have collected around \u20ac63,000 in CAP funds.\nCarlos Ruiz-Ramirez, author of a 2024 Oxfam report on migrant workers\u2019 experiences in Europe, says it is imperative for the EU and national governments to close subsidy loopholes and ramp up labour inspections.\u201cWorkers are being exploited on Europe\u2019s farms,\u201d he told DeSmog, \u201cand EU subsidies are bankrolling this.\u201d\nInformal migrant settlement in Huelva, Spain. Credit: Eoghan Gilmartin\n\u2018Cosmetic Measure\u2019\nWidespread labour abuses in Europe\u2019s fields were meant to be addressed through \u2018social conditionality\u2019. Under the flagship reform \u2013 negotiated in 2021 and implemented across the EU this year \u2013 farmers would have to comply with minimum social and labour standards to receive payments, and be fined a percentage of the CAP funding if they did not comply.\nFrance was one of the three member states to voluntarily introduce the reform in January 2023, along with Italy and Austria. However, not a single penalty has yet been imposed by French authorities.\nThe mechanism is informally set to be reviewed in 2027. But at this point the re-design of the measure for the next CAP period, which runs from 2028 to 2034, will have already been decided.\n\u201cThere is still absolutely no channel of communication set up between the CAP paying agencies and the labour inspectorate [in France],\u201d explains Lucas Dejeux from the Conf\u00e9d\u00e9ration G\u00e9n\u00e9rale du Travail (CGT), one of France\u2019s five big trade unions, who said that those authorising CAP payments often aren\u2019t even aware when farmers are convicted for violations.\u00a0\n\u201cWe have not received an internal memo on the subject\u2026 there is nothing at all,\u201d he adds. Two other labour inspectors, who wished to remain anonymous, corroborated this.Under the reform, fines for labour abuse are issued as a subsidy cut of up to 10 percent, generally rising to 30 percent for repeat offenders. The penalties are only ever imposed as a one-off reduction on funds from the year of the offence.\nIn Austria, this has happened just once. A farmer was ordered to pay more than \u20ac3,000 for breaching social conditionality on two separate occasions in 2023 and 2024 \u2013 docking just four percent off the average 40,000 euros he received annually in CAP subsidies. He was fined three per cent of his CAP payments in 2023, which was increased to five per cent due to the repeated violation.\u00a0\nAccording to the Spanish ministry of agriculture, 227 beneficiaries of CAP subsidies were penalised under social conditionality in 2024, mostly with a three percent reduction of their funds. The figure is tiny compared to the scale of abuses detected in the sector every year. The latest available figures for 2023 show the labour inspectorate recorded 7,449 labour violations in agriculture.\nYoan Molinero, senior researcher at Comillas University\u2019s centre for migration studies, says even these moderate sanctions will also only be applied against basic direct payments, whereas most funding to the fruit and vegetable sector \u2013 where the worst labour abuses take place \u2013 is received through other CAP schemes.\nIndeed, all of the \u20ac3.4 million received in 2024 by the Huelva berry producer would be exempt from sanctions under current rules, since it was paid from a sector-specific aid program.\nFor Molinero, the cases reviewed by DeSmog cases reflect \u201cthe total disconnect between subsidies and social conditions of production.\u201d\nIn its current form, social conditionality is \u201cless an initial step in the right direction towards protecting workers,\u201d Molinero said, \u201cand more a cosmetic measure designed to offer the semblance of change while maintaining the CAP status quo\u201d. Its impact on offending farmers will be \u201cnegligible,\u201d he said.\n\u00c9ric Sargiacomo, a French social democratic MEP and vice chair of the agriculture committee, agrees. \u201cThe level of sanctions are too low to operate as a deterrent,\u201d he told DeSmog.\nAs the centre-right European People\u2019s Party increasingly aligns itself with far-right forces on agricultural policy, the risk with the next CAP reform is that social conditionality will be weakened further. The Commission\u2019s new proposal \u2013 to be introduced in 2028 \u2013 would exempt farms under ten hectares from controls and penalties, effectively exempting around 70 percent of farms from sanctions.\u00a0\n\u201cWorkers\u2019 rights can\u2019t depend on the size of the farm,\u201d said Cristina Guarda, an Italian Green MEP and farmer. \u201cIt\u2019s like saying exploitation is acceptable as long as it happens on a small scale. Being underpaid [as smallscale farmers] doesn\u2019t give us the right to violate others\u2019 rights.\u201d\nGuarda\u2019s counter proposal, and that of the European Federation of Food, Agriculture, and Tourism Trade Unions (EFFAT), is to strengthen social conditionality through withholding CAP payments. She explains this would mean any farmer under investigation for serious labour abuses would have their subsidies automatically stopped in advance until the proceedings in the case are fully resolved.\n\u201cFarmers with a serious history of labour violations, exploitation, or anti-union practices should not have access to public funds,\u201d Guarda told DeSmog.\n\u201cDecent work and good food must be a core goal of EU food policy,\u201d added Olivier De Schutter of IPES-Food. \u201cYet instead of raising the bar, the Commission\u2019s latest CAP reform proposals risk further weakening social and environmental standards. Europe cannot afford a race to the bottom in its food system.\u201d\u00a0\nAdditional reporting by Pascale M\u00fcller\nEditing by Phoebe Cooke and Clare Carlile\nThis investigation also appeared in El Salto Diario (Spain), profil (Austria), L\u2019Humanit\u00e9 (France), FragDenStaat (Germany), Taz.die Tageszeitung (Germany) and L\u2019Espresso (Italy).\n\nThe post Revealed: EU Farm Subsidy \u2018Bankrolls\u2019 Widespread Labour Abuse appeared first on DeSmog.",

      "description": "In an embarrassing error, PayPal blockchain partner Paxos accidentally minted 300 trillion of the PYUSD token today. PayPal's stablecoin, which it debuted in 2023, is supposed to be redeemable at a 1:1 rate for US dollars. $300 trillion is more than double the entire world's current GDP of $117 trillion. In short, that's a really bad mistake from Paxos.At least the action did appear to be a mistake.
