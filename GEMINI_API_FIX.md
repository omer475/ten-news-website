# 🔧 GEMINI API FIX

## ❌ **PROBLEM**

The live news system was failing at Step 1 with error:
```
❌ Unexpected error: No valid content in Gemini response
❌ No articles approved by Gemini
⏭️ No articles processed - skipping cycle
```

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE**

Two issues identified:

### **1. Wrong Model Name**
- **Old**: `gemini-2.5-flash` (doesn't exist yet)
- **New**: `gemini-2.0-flash-exp` (correct current model)

### **2. Poor Error Handling**
- System didn't show what was actually wrong with Gemini response
- No visibility into safety filters, blocked content, or API errors

## ✅ **FIXES APPLIED**

### **Fix 1: Updated Model Name**
```python
# OLD:
url = f"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:generateContent?key={api_key}"

# NEW:
url = f"https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp:generateContent?key={api_key}"
```

### **Fix 2: Enhanced Error Handling**
Added detailed debugging:
- Check for `finishReason` in response
- Detect safety filters (`SAFETY`, `RECITATION`, `OTHER`)
- Print safety ratings if content is blocked
- Show actual response structure when parsing fails

```python
# Check for safety ratings or blocked content
if 'finishReason' in candidate:
    finish_reason = candidate['finishReason']
    if finish_reason != 'STOP':
        print(f"⚠️ Gemini response finished with reason: {finish_reason}")
        if finish_reason in ['SAFETY', 'RECITATION', 'OTHER']:
            print(f"❌ Content blocked or filtered by Gemini")
            if 'safetyRatings' in candidate:
                print(f"Safety ratings: {candidate['safetyRatings']}")
            return {"approved": [], "filtered": articles}
```

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT**

✅ **Commits**:
1. `1bb52aa` - Add better error handling and debugging for Gemini API responses
2. `694b03d` - Fix Gemini model name from gemini-2.5-flash to gemini-2.0-flash-exp

✅ **Status**: Deployed to GitHub (origin/main)

## 📊 **EXPECTED RESULT**

Next cycle (at 13:30:23) should:
1. ✅ Gemini API successfully scores articles
2. ✅ Articles with score ≥700 get approved
3. ✅ Approved articles proceed to Step 2 (Jina full text fetching)
4. ✅ Full pipeline runs successfully

If issues persist, the enhanced error handling will show exactly what's wrong.

## 🔄 **MONITORING**

Watch the next cycle output for:
- ✅ Gemini scoring success: "✅ Step 1: X/Y articles approved"
- ⚠️ Safety filters: "Content blocked or filtered by Gemini"
- ❌ API errors: Detailed response structure will be printed
