# 🚀 Vercel Deployment Guide for Ten News Website

## ✅ Pre-Deployment Checklist

Your project is now fully configured for Vercel deployment with:
- ✅ `vercel.json` configuration file
- ✅ Next.js framework setup
- ✅ API route for serving news data
- ✅ Proper build scripts in `package.json`
- ✅ Environment-ready code

## 📋 Step-by-Step Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Create Vercel Account
1. Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
2. Click "Sign Up"
3. **Choose "Continue with GitHub"** (IMPORTANT: Use same GitHub account)
4. Authorize Vercel to access your GitHub

### Step 2: Import Your Project
1. After login, click **"New Project"**
2. Under "Import Git Repository", you should see `omer475/ten-news-website`
3. Click **"Import"** next to your repository

### Step 3: Configure Project Settings
1. **Framework Preset**: Should auto-detect as "Next.js"
2. **Root Directory**: Leave as `./` (default)
3. **Build Command**: `npm run build` (should be pre-filled)
4. **Output Directory**: Leave as default
5. **Install Command**: `npm install` (should be pre-filled)

### Step 4: Environment Variables (Optional)
You don't need any environment variables for the basic website. The news data is generated by GitHub Actions and committed to the repository.

### Step 5: Deploy
1. Click **"Deploy"**
2. Wait 1-3 minutes for deployment
3. You'll get a URL like: `ten-news-website.vercel.app`

## 🔄 Automatic Updates

### How It Works:
1. **Every day at 7 AM**: GitHub Actions generates new news
2. **News files committed**: to your repository
3. **Vercel auto-deploys**: within minutes of the commit
4. **Website updates**: automatically with fresh content

### The Flow:
```
GitHub Actions (7 AM) → Generate News → Commit Files → Vercel Auto-Deploy → Live Website Updated
```

## 🌐 Your Website Features

### What Will Work:
- ✅ Daily fresh news content (10 articles)
- ✅ Smooth scroll navigation
- ✅ Touch/swipe support on mobile
- ✅ Keyboard navigation
- ✅ Progress indicators
- ✅ Historical events display
- ✅ Responsive design
- ✅ Newsletter signup (UI only)

### API Endpoint:
- Your website will have an API at: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/news`
- This returns the latest news data in JSON format

## 🔧 Post-Deployment

### Custom Domain (Optional):
1. In Vercel dashboard → Settings → Domains
2. Add your custom domain
3. Follow DNS configuration instructions

### Performance:
Your site will automatically have:
- ✅ HTTPS/SSL certificate
- ✅ Global CDN distribution
- ✅ Automatic caching
- ✅ Fast loading times

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **News Data**: Generated daily by GitHub Actions, not Vercel
2. **Updates**: Automatic when new commits are pushed
3. **API Key**: Stored securely in GitHub Secrets (not Vercel)
4. **Build Time**: Usually under 2 minutes

## 🎯 Deployment URL Structure

After deployment, your URLs will be:
- **Production**: `ten-news-website.vercel.app`
- **Preview**: `ten-news-website-git-main-omer475.vercel.app`
- **API**: `ten-news-website.vercel.app/api/news`

## 📱 Testing Your Deployment

1. **Desktop**: Visit your Vercel URL
2. **Mobile**: Test touch gestures
3. **API**: Visit `/api/news` to see JSON data
4. **Speed**: Should load in under 1 second

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### If deployment fails:
1. Check build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Ensure all files are committed to GitHub
3. Verify package.json has correct dependencies

### If news doesn't update:
1. Check GitHub Actions ran successfully
2. Verify news JSON files are in repository
3. Check Vercel deployment triggered

## ✨ Success Indicators

You'll know it's working when:
1. ✅ Vercel shows "Ready" status
2. ✅ Website loads with news content
