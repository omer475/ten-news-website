# ✅ Swipe Feature Successfully Deployed to tennews.ai

## 🎉 **LIVE NOW on https://tennews.ai**

**Latest Commit:** 913032a  
**Deployed:** October 20, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ LIVE AND WORKING

---

## 📱 **How to Use**

### On Mobile/Tablet:
1. Open any news story
2. Find the summary text (below the title)
3. **Make a small swipe gesture** (left OR right) on the summary text
4. Text will toggle between paragraph and bullet points
5. Swipe again to toggle back

### On Desktop:
- **Press 'S' key** to toggle
- **Click** to navigate to source

---

## 🎯 **What Changed (Latest Update)**

### Version 2 - Better Responsiveness
- **Reduced swipe threshold** from 50px → 15px
- Now responds to much **smaller swipe gestures**
- More sensitive and natural feeling
- Still distinguishes horizontal from vertical swipes

### Version 1 - Initial Release
- Added swipe detection
- Added summary_bullets support
- Added visual indicators
- Added keyboard shortcuts

---

## 📊 **Technical Details**

### Swipe Thresholds:
```javascript
// Movement detection
if (diffX > 5 || diffY > 5) {
  hasMoved = true;
}

// Horizontal swipe (toggle)
if (diffX > diffY && diffX > 15) {
  swipeDirection = 'horizontal';
  // Toggle summary/bullets
}

// Vertical swipe (navigate stories)
if (diffY > diffX && diffY > 30) {
  swipeDirection = 'vertical';
  // Navigate between stories
}
```

### Why 15px?
- **Too low (< 10px)**: Accidental triggers, conflicts with scrolling
- **Too high (> 30px)**: Feels unresponsive, requires large gesture
- **15px**: Sweet spot - responsive but intentional

## 🔍 **What You'll See**

### Default View (Summary Paragraph):
```
📰 Breaking News Title

This is a 35-40 word paragraph explaining
the key points of the news story in a 
narrative format...

[Summary] ← Swipe → or press S
```

### After Swipe (Bullet Points):
```
📰 Breaking News Title

• First key point from the summary
• Second key point from the summary
• Third key point from the summary

[Bullets] ← Swipe → or press S
```

4. **Verify** you're swiping on the summary text (not title or details)

### If mode indicator doesn't update:
1. Check if `summary_bullets` data exists
2. Verify API is returning the field
3. Check browser console for data

### If conflicts with story navigation:
- Swipe should be clearly horizontal (15px minimum)
