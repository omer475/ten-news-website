# Step 1: Gemini Scoring Prompt - Complete Overhaul

**Date**: October 24, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ COMPLETE

---

## üéØ **What Changed**

Completely rewrote the Step 1 Gemini scoring prompt with a **much more comprehensive, human-centered approach** that focuses on what people actually want to read and share.

---

## üß† **New Philosophy**

### Old Approach:
- Mechanical scoring (add up points across 5 categories)
- Focused on "shareability" metrics
- Less guidance on what to filter

### New Approach:
- **Holistic judgment** (think like a friend curating news)
- **Three core questions**:
  1. "Did something happen?" (events > analysis)
  2. "Would I tell someone about this?" (genuinely interesting)
  3. "Does this matter to regular people?" (not just specialists)
- **Detailed content type understanding** (news vs trends/analysis/predictions)
- **Clear filtering guidelines** with examples

---

## üìö **New Prompt Structure**

### 1. YOUR MINDSET
Sets the tone: You're curating for intelligent, busy people who want:
- What happened TODAY?
- Surprising things that make you say "wow"
- Stay informed without wasting time

**Core principle**: Events & surprises, not analysis & trends.

### 2. THE THREE CORE QUESTIONS
Explicit framework for evaluating each article:

**"DID SOMETHING HAPPEN?"**
- ‚úÖ Good: "Congress passes bill," "Earthquake strikes"
- ‚ùå Bad: "ETFs gaining popularity" (trend, not event)

**"WOULD I ACTUALLY TELL SOMEONE ABOUT THIS?"**
- ‚úÖ Good: "Not exercising deadlier than smoking" (shocking!)
- ‚ùå Bad: "Active ETFs shift market share" (boring)

**"DOES THIS MATTER TO REGULAR PEOPLE?"**
- ‚úÖ Good: Fed rate decision (affects everyone)
- ‚ùå Bad: One person fired from store (local)

### 3. UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE'RE SEEING
Deep dive into content types:

**IS THIS NEWS OR SOMETHING ELSE?**
- News = Something happened
- Not News = Analysis, trends, predictions, features, opinions

**IS THIS ABOUT AN EVENT OR A SITUATION?**
- Event = Specific time, breaking, new
- Situation = Ongoing state, gradual change

**IS THIS GLOBAL OR LOCAL?**
- Global = Millions affected, broad significance
- Local = Few people, regional only

**IS THIS SURPRISING OR EXPECTED?**
- Surprising = "Wait, really?!"
- Expected = "Yeah, that makes sense"

**IS THIS BREAKING OR EVERGREEN?**
- Breaking = Just happened, urgent
- Evergreen = Could run anytime

### 4. WHAT TO FILTER (Understanding, Not Keywords)
Detailed explanations of 8 types to always filter:

1. **Market Predictions & Analyst Opinions**
   - What: Guessing about future
   - Example: "Bank warns S&P 500 near peak"

2. **Trend Pieces & Market Shifts**
   - What: Gradual changes over time
   - Example: "ETFs gaining popularity"

3. **Feature Stories & Program Descriptions**
   - What: Background pieces
   - Example: "Schools address gap through programs"

4. **Local Incidents With One Person/Business**
   - What: Individual stories
   - Example: "Store fires volunteer"

5. **Retrospective Analysis & Documentaries**
   - What: Looking back at past
   - Example: "Documentary reveals details"

6. **Technical/Niche Updates**
   - What: Industry-specific
   - Example: "Technical indicators trigger"

7. **Ongoing Situations Without New Developments**
   - What: Status updates
   - Example: "Day 347 of conflict"

8. **Old News (>7 days)**
   - What: Too long ago
   - Example: "Blue Jays won 1993 World Series"

### 5. SPECIAL CASES: When To Approve Borderline Content

**STUDIES & RESEARCH**
- ‚úÖ Approve: "Did you know?!" quality (shocking comparisons)
- ‚ùå Filter: Confirming what we know

**POLITICAL NEWS**
- ‚úÖ Approve: Final, completed action (bill passed)
- ‚ùå Filter: Procedural or theatrical (debate, speech)

**SPORTS NEWS**
- ‚úÖ Approve: Championship or historic moment
- ‚ùå Filter: Regular games, contracts

**BUSINESS/ECONOMY**
- ‚úÖ Approve: Broadly impactful (Fed rates)
- ‚ùå Filter: Industry-specific (ETF market share)

**INTERESTING FACTS**
- ‚úÖ Approve: Surprising revelation (if revealed today)
- Must still be NEWS, not encyclopedia entry

### 6. YOUR APPROACH TO SCORING
The actual mindset to use:

**Think**: You're curating for your intelligent friend who's busy.

**Show them**:
- What HAPPENED today (events, not analysis)
- Surprising things they didn't know
- Major world events
- Skip boring procedural stuff
- Skip niche industry content
- Skip one-person local stories
- Skip predictions and warnings
- Skip features and explainers

**Score 700-1000 (APPROVE)** when:
- Something actually happened (event, not trend)
- It's breaking news (recent, timely)
- It's surprising OR broadly important (preferably both)
- People would actually talk about this
- General audience cares (not just specialists)

**Score BELOW 700 (FILTER)** when:
- Nothing actually happened
- It's old news (>7 days)
- It's boring even if "important"
- It's local/individual story
- It's niche content for specialists only
- It's opinion/analysis rather than news
- Nobody would bring this up in conversation

### 7. SCORING FACTORS (Holistic, Not Mechanical)
Five factors to consider together:

1. **RECENCY & TIMELINESS**
   - Just happened today ‚Üí very high
   - Old news (>7 days) ‚Üí low

2. **SURPRISE & WOW FACTOR**
   - Mind-blowing ‚Üí very high
   - Obvious ‚Üí very low

3. **IMPACT & SCALE**
   - Hundreds of millions ‚Üí very high
   - Individual/local ‚Üí very low

4. **CONVERSATION-WORTHINESS**
   - Everyone will talk ‚Üí very high
   - Nobody would mention ‚Üí very low

5. **EDUCATIONAL VALUE**
   - Fundamental new knowledge ‚Üí very high
   - No educational value ‚Üí very low

**Key**: Don't calculate mechanically - use judgment!
- Breaking but boring: might score 700
- Fascinating study: might score 850
- Local story: might score 300
- Analyst prediction: might score 400

### 8. SOURCE CREDIBILITY

**HIGH CREDIBILITY (trust them)**:
Reuters, AP, AFP, BBC, CNN, Al Jazeera, NPR, NYT, WSJ, Washington Post, The Guardian, Financial Times, Bloomberg, The Economist, Nature, Science

**MODERATE CREDIBILITY**: Established national outlets, quality regional papers

**LOW CREDIBILITY**: Blogs, aggregators, questionable sources

**ZERO CREDIBILITY**: Tabloids, conspiracy sites, satirical sources

### 9. CATEGORY ASSIGNMENT
Choose ONE category:
- Politics
- Economy
- International
- Health
- Science
- Technology
- Environment
- Disaster
- Sports
- Culture
- Other

### 10. OUTPUT FORMAT
JSON array with:
- `title`: exact article title
- `score`: 0-1000
- `category`: one of above
- `status`: "APPROVED" (‚â•700) or "FILTERED" (<700)
- `score_breakdown`: shows thinking (recency, surprise, impact, conversation, educational)

### 11. REMEMBER YOUR MISSION
Final reminder:
- Help people stay informed without wasting time
- Think: "Would I want to read this? Would I tell someone?"
- Be selective, be ruthless with boring content
- Only approve genuinely newsworthy and interesting

**Priorities**:
- Events > Analysis
- Breaking > Features
- Surprising > Expected
- Global > Local
- News > Trends

**TARGET: 10% approval rate** - Only the best stuff makes it through.
